## 01 — What Are Money Scripts?

You make dozens of financial decisions every week: whether to save or spend, which purchase to prioritise, whether to check your bank balance or avoid it. Most people assume these decisions are rational calculations. They're not.

They are driven by **money scripts** — deeply held, often unconscious beliefs about money formed in childhood and reinforced over time.

> **Definition:** Money scripts are unconscious beliefs about money, formed primarily in childhood through family messages, cultural context, and early experiences. They operate automatically, influencing financial behaviour without conscious awareness.

Money scripts answer questions like:
- Is money fundamentally good or bad?
- Do I deserve to have money?
- Is wealth achievable or only for others?
- Should I save obsessively or spend freely?
- Does money create security or anxiety?

You may have never consciously thought about these questions — but you have answers to them, buried in your automatic reactions to money. And those answers shape your financial life far more than any budget spreadsheet ever will.

> **Note — Most Money Scripts Are Invisible:** The defining feature of a money script is that you don't notice it operating. It feels like "just how things are" or "common sense." The beliefs that most powerfully control your behaviour are the ones you've never questioned. This lesson is about surfacing those beliefs so you can examine them consciously.

## 02 — The Four Money Scripts

In the early 2000s, financial psychologists Brad Klontz and Ted Klontz conducted extensive research into how people's unconscious beliefs about money affect their financial outcomes. They identified four distinct categories of money scripts — each associated with specific behaviours and outcomes.

Most people are influenced by more than one script, but typically one is dominant.

![The Four Money Scripts](chart_1_1_6_A_four_scripts.png)
*Figure 1.1.6-A — The four money scripts framework developed by Klontz & Britt. Positioned along two axes: emotional relationship with money (stress vs. security) and behavioural tendency (restrictive vs. expressive).*

### The Four Scripts Explained

### 1. Money Avoidance

**Core belief:** Money is bad, corrupting, or something to be distrusted. Rich people are greedy. I don't deserve wealth.

**Typical behaviours:**
- Avoiding thinking about finances
- Self-sabotaging financial success (undearning, rejecting raises)
- Giving money away compulsively
- Feeling guilty about having money
- Financial procrastination and neglect

**Origin:** Often comes from religious or cultural messages that money is "the root of all evil," or from witnessing wealthy people behave badly.

**Financial outcomes:** Chronic undearning, financial instability, avoiding career advancement, poor financial records.

---

### 2. Money Worship

**Core belief:** Money is the solution to all problems. More money equals more happiness. There's never enough.

**Typical behaviours:**
- Overworking at the expense of health and relationships
- Believing happiness is always "one more raise away"
- Hoarding wealth but never feeling secure
- Taking excessive financial risks
- Measuring self-worth by net worth

**Origin:** Often comes from experiencing financial instability in childhood, or observing that money brought relief from stress.

**Financial outcomes:** High earnings but low satisfaction, burnout, strained relationships, vulnerability to scams promising quick wealth.

---

### 3. Money Vigilance

**Core belief:** You must always be careful with money. Saving is virtuous. You can't trust others with money. Prepare for disaster.

**Typical behaviours:**
- Extreme frugality
- Anxiety about spending even on necessities
- Distrusting financial advisors or partners
- Refusing to enjoy money
- Obsessive tracking and budgeting

**Origin:** Often comes from experiencing financial hardship, particularly in childhood, or from parents who modelled extreme caution.

**Financial outcomes:** High savings rates, financial security, but often accompanied by chronic anxiety and inability to enjoy wealth.

---

### 4. Money Status

**Core belief:** Money defines self-worth. Net worth equals self-worth. Spending demonstrates success.

**Typical behaviours:**
- Spending to project an image of success
- Keeping up with peers' lifestyles
- Buying luxury items as status symbols
- Using debt to maintain appearances
- Comparing financial position to others obsessively

**Origin:** Often comes from environments where status was highly valued, or where love and approval were conditional on achievement.

**Financial outcomes:** High spending relative to income, lifestyle inflation, consumer debt, financial stress despite good income.

### Table 1.1.6-A — The Four Money Scripts at a Glance

| Money Script | Core Belief | Emotional Driver | Typical Behaviour | Main Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Money Avoidance** | Money is bad/corrupt | Guilt, mistrust | Undearning, neglect, giving away | Chronic instability |
| **Money Worship** | Money = happiness | Fear of scarcity | Overwork, hoarding, risk | Burnout, never enough |
| **Money Vigilance** | Must be careful always | Anxiety, distrust | Extreme saving, frugality | Inability to enjoy |
| **Money Status** | Money = self-worth | Insecurity, comparison | Spending on image, debt | Lifestyle inflation, debt |

> **Note — Scripts Overlap and Evolve:** Most people carry elements of multiple scripts, and your dominant script can shift over time or in different contexts. You might be Money Vigilant with your savings but Money Status with your clothing. The goal isn't to fit neatly into one box — it's to recognise which patterns influence you and whether they're helping or hurting.

## 03 — Where Money Scripts Come From

Money scripts are learned, not innate. And they're learned early — most are firmly established by age 12-14.

![Where Do Your Money Beliefs Come From?](chart_1_1_6_B_belief_sources.png)
*Figure 1.1.6-B — Sources of money beliefs. Family and early childhood experiences account for roughly 65% of influence. Based on financial psychology research.*

### The Primary Sources

**1. Parents and Family (42%)**

Not what your parents *said* about money — what they *did*. Children absorb financial attitudes through observation:
- Did your parents argue about money? → Money = conflict
- Did they avoid discussing money? → Money = taboo/shame
- Did they seem stressed about bills? → Money = anxiety
- Did they spend freely and joyfully? → Money = freedom

Most powerful: the unspoken emotional atmosphere around money in your home.

**2. Childhood Experiences (23%)**

Specific early experiences create lasting imprints:
- Experiencing poverty or financial crisis
- Sudden wealth or loss
- Receiving (or not receiving) money as a child
- Watching a parent lose a job
- Being told "we can't afford that" repeatedly

These experiences create templates: "this is what money means" and "this is how you must behave to survive."

**3. Peer Group (14%)**

Particularly powerful during adolescence:
- Comparing what you had to what friends had
- Being included or excluded based on money
- Developing spending patterns to fit in
- Internalising group norms about what's "worth" spending on

**4. Media and Culture (11%)**

Broader cultural messages absorbed passively:
- "Greed is good" vs. "money is the root of evil"
- Celebrity worship and conspicuous consumption
- Rags-to-riches narratives
- Advertising messages about what defines success

> **Note — Early Memories Have Disproportionate Power:** A single vivid childhood memory — being denied something you desperately wanted, watching your parents lose their home, or receiving unexpected money — can shape financial behaviour for decades. Financial psychologists often ask clients about their earliest money memory because it frequently reveals their dominant money script.

## 04 — Common Limiting Beliefs

Some money beliefs support financial wellbeing. Others actively undermine it. These are the most common limiting beliefs that show up repeatedly in financial psychology research:

![Common Limiting Money Beliefs → Reframed](chart_1_1_6_C_belief_reframes.png)
*Figure 1.1.6-C — Five of the most common limiting money beliefs and their reframed alternatives.*

### Table 1.1.6-B — Limiting Beliefs and Their Corrections

| Limiting Belief | Why It's Harmful | Reframed Belief |
|---|---|---|
| "Money doesn't grow on trees" | Creates scarcity mindset; blocks seeing opportunities | Money is a renewable resource created through value |
| "Rich people are greedy/corrupt" | Prevents wealth accumulation; creates guilt about success | Wealth can be earned ethically and used for good |
| "I'm just not good with money" | Fixed mindset; stops learning and improvement | Financial skills can be learned at any age |
| "Money is the root of all evil" | Creates avoidance and self-sabotage | Money is neutral — it amplifies existing values |
| "I don't deserve to be wealthy" | Leads to undearning and self-sabotage | Everyone deserves financial security and opportunity |
| "There's never enough" | Creates hoarding and chronic anxiety | Abundance is possible; enough can be defined |
| "Money can't buy happiness" (used to justify not trying) | Excuse for financial neglect | Money enables choices that support wellbeing |
| "I'll be happy when I'm rich" | Delays happiness; never arrives | Contentment and financial health can coexist now |

> **Note — Beliefs Aren't True or False, They're Useful or Not:** The question isn't whether a money belief is objectively true — it's whether it *serves you*. "I'm not good with money" might feel true based on past evidence, but holding that belief guarantees it will remain true because it blocks learning. The reframe isn't about denying reality — it's about opening possibility.

## 05 — How Money Scripts Drive Financial Outcomes

Money scripts aren't just abstract beliefs — they produce measurable, real-world financial consequences.

![Financial Outcomes by Dominant Money Script](chart_1_1_6_D_outcomes_by_script.png)
*Figure 1.1.6-D — People with different dominant money scripts show dramatically different financial behaviours and outcomes. Based on research by Klontz et al. Illustrative figures.*

### The Pattern in the Data

Look at the chart. People with **Money Vigilance** as their dominant script have:
- The highest savings rate (18.3% vs. 2-5% for other scripts)
- The lowest credit card debt (€800 vs. €4,200-€8,200)
- Moderate financial stress (6.2/10 — they worry but have resources)
- Moderate satisfaction (5.8/10 — they're secure but don't enjoy it)

People with **Money Status** as their dominant script have:
- Low savings rate (3.4%)
- The highest debt (€8,200 on credit cards)
- High financial stress (7.2/10)
- Moderate satisfaction (4.7/10 — appearance of success, reality of stress)

This isn't correlation — money scripts *cause* these outcomes by determining which financial behaviours feel natural and which feel wrong.

### Table 1.1.6-C — How Each Script Shapes Outcomes

| Money Script | Financial Strength | Financial Vulnerability | Long-term Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Money Avoidance** | Often generous, non-materialistic | Chronic undearning, neglect | Financial instability, dependence |
| **Money Worship** | High earning potential, motivated | Burnout, never satisfied, scams | Relationship breakdown, health issues |
| **Money Vigilance** | High savings, financial security | Anxiety, can't enjoy wealth | Regret, strained relationships |
| **Money Status** | Can motivate income growth | Overspending, debt, comparison | Debt spiral, retirement shortfall |

> **Note — No Script Is All Good or All Bad:** Money Vigilance produces great savings rates but chronic anxiety. Money Status can motivate career success but leads to debt. The goal isn't to eliminate your money script — it's to recognise its trade-offs and consciously modulate its influence. A bit of Money Vigilance is useful. Pure Money Vigilance is exhausting.

## 06 — Identifying Your Own Money Scripts

Most people have never consciously examined their money beliefs. This exercise starts that process.

### The Money Script Reflection Questions

Answer these honestly — your first instinctive response is usually the most revealing:

**Money Avoidance Indicators:**
- Do you feel guilty or uncomfortable when you have money?
- Do you believe rich people are generally bad or selfish?
- Do you avoid looking at your bank account or financial statements?
- Do you give money away compulsively, even when it harms you?
- Do you self-sabotage career opportunities that would increase income?

**Money Worship Indicators:**
- Do you believe more money would solve most of your problems?
- Do you think about money constantly?
- Do you feel you'll never have "enough" no matter how much you earn?
- Do you sacrifice relationships and health to earn more?
- Do you judge yourself and others primarily by income/net worth?

**Money Vigilance Indicators:**
- Do you feel anxious whenever you spend money, even on necessities?
- Do you distrust others with money (banks, advisors, even partners)?
- Do you save obsessively even when financially secure?
- Do you feel guilty enjoying money you've earned?
- Do you believe disaster is always around the corner financially?

**Money Status Indicators:**
- Do you spend money to impress others or maintain an image?
- Do you compare your possessions and lifestyle to others constantly?
- Do you feel pressure to "look successful" even when struggling?
- Do you buy things you can't afford to maintain appearances?
- Do you equate your self-worth with your net worth?

If you answered "yes" to 3+ questions in any category, that script likely has significant influence on your financial behaviour.

## 07 — Changing Your Money Scripts

Money scripts are learned, which means they can be *unlearned* — or more accurately, rewritten. But they won't change through willpower alone. They require deliberate intervention.

### Table 1.1.6-D — Strategies to Rewrite Money Scripts

| Strategy | How It Works | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Name the script** | Awareness reduces automatic power | "I'm noticing my Money Avoidance script right now" |
| **Question the origin** | Understanding where it came from creates distance | "This belief came from my dad's job loss — does it still apply?" |
| **Test the belief** | Examine evidence for and against it | "Is it true that I'm *bad* with money, or did I just lack knowledge?" |
| **Reframe actively** | Replace limiting belief with empowering alternative | Replace "Money is bad" with "Money is a tool I can use well" |
| **New experiences** | Behave as if the new script is true; collect evidence | If you believe "I don't deserve wealth," practice receiving without guilt |
| **Journaling** | Write about money experiences and notice patterns | Track times when old script activates; document new beliefs |
| **Therapy / coaching** | Professional support for deep or traumatic money scripts | Financial therapy specifically addresses money psychology |
| **Affirmations (with action)** | Repetition + evidence builds new neural pathways | "I am learning to manage money well" + take a course |

> **Note — Change Is Gradual, Not Instant:** You've been running your current money scripts for 10-20+ years. They won't vanish after reading one lesson or doing one exercise. Changing money scripts is more like rehabilitation than revelation — repeated practice over months, with setbacks, until the new pattern becomes automatic. Be patient with yourself.

## 08 — Real-World Examples

### Example 1 — Elena's Money Avoidance Script

> *"Elena, 24, works as a freelance designer earning €45k/year — good income for her age. But she consistently underbids on projects, doesn't chase late payments, and felt physically sick when her income crossed €50k. In therapy, she uncovered a childhood memory: her mother constantly saying 'rich people are greedy' and 'we don't need much to be happy.' Elena had unconsciously internalised: earning a lot = being greedy = being a bad person."*

Elena's Money Avoidance script was literally costing her €15k+/year in undearning. Once identified, she could challenge it: "Can I be financially successful *and* ethical? Can I earn well *and* be generous?" Within a year of reframing, she raised her rates by 40%, stopped feeling guilty about her income, and started building savings for the first time.

**The lesson:** Money scripts don't just affect attitudes — they directly shape earning and spending behaviour.

---

### Example 2 — James's Money Worship

> *"James, 32, earned €120k/year as a consultant but worked 70-hour weeks, hadn't taken a holiday in three years, and had no close relationships. He believed 'when I hit €200k, I'll relax.' In coaching, he realised he'd been telling himself this at €60k, then €80k, then €100k. The target kept moving because the script was 'there's never enough.'"*

James's Money Worship script created a treadmill: no amount of money could satisfy the belief driving the behaviour, because the belief was about *fear of scarcity*, not about any specific amount. When he reframed to "I can have enough and be secure," he cut his hours, started dating, and reported being far happier on the same income.

**The lesson:** Money Worship scripts promise happiness at some future income level — but that future never arrives because the script is unfulfillable.

---

### Example 3 — The Couple Conflict

> *"Ana grew up wealthy; money meant freedom and possibility (Money Status tendency). Tomás grew up poor; money meant anxiety and careful control (Money Vigilance). They married and immediately clashed: Ana wanted to travel, spend on experiences, and 'enjoy life.' Tomás wanted to save aggressively, avoid risk, and 'be prepared.' Neither was wrong — but their scripts were invisible and in direct conflict."*

Once they named their scripts and understood where each came from, they could negotiate: Ana acknowledged Tomás's need for security was real and valid; Tomás acknowledged Ana's desire for experiences wasn't reckless. They set a compromise: save 20% (Tomás's security), spend 15% on experiences (Ana's freedom), cover needs with the rest. Both scripts honoured.

**The lesson:** Money conflicts in relationships are almost always money *script* conflicts. Solving them requires surfacing and respecting the beliefs underneath the behaviour.

---

## Lesson Summary

- **Money scripts** are unconscious beliefs about money formed in childhood that drive financial behaviour automatically
- The four main scripts are: **Money Avoidance, Money Worship, Money Vigilance, and Money Status**
- Scripts come primarily from **family (42%), childhood experiences (23%), and peer groups (14%)**
- Each script has both strengths and vulnerabilities — none is purely good or bad
- Common limiting beliefs include "I'm not good with money," "rich people are greedy," and "money is the root of evil"
- People with different dominant scripts show **dramatically different financial outcomes** — savings rates, debt levels, and financial stress all vary by script
- Money scripts can be changed through: naming them, questioning origins, testing beliefs, reframing, new experiences, and professional support
- Change is **gradual** — money scripts took years to form and take time to rewrite
