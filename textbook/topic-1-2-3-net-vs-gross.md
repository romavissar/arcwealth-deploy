## 01 — The Number That Matters vs. The Number You're Told

When you receive a job offer, you're told a gross salary — for example, "€35,000 per year." This number appears on your contract, on job advertisements, and in salary negotiations. But it is **not** the money that arrives in your bank account.

> **Definition — Gross Income:** The total amount you earn before any deductions. This is the headline number on your job offer, contract, or payslip.

> **Definition — Net Income (Take-Home Pay):** The actual amount that lands in your bank account after all mandatory deductions (taxes, insurance, pension contributions, etc.).

The difference between gross and net is enormous — often 20-30% or more depending on your income level and country. Understanding this gap is essential for realistic financial planning.

*Figure 1.2.3-A — Waterfall chart showing how €35,000 gross salary becomes €25,630 net through four major deductions. Total deductions: €9,370 (26.8% of gross). Illustrative rates.*

> **Note — The Single Most Common Financial Planning Mistake:** Budgeting based on gross income instead of net. If you plan to spend €2,917/month (your gross monthly salary) but only receive €2,136 (your net), you will be short €781 every single month — €9,372 per year. This is not a small error. It is catastrophic. Always budget on net.

## 02 — The Four Major Deductions

Four main categories of deductions reduce gross to net. The specifics vary significantly by country, but the categories are consistent across most developed economies.

### 1. Income Tax

**What it is:** Tax on your earnings, paid to the national or regional government to fund public services (healthcare, education, infrastructure, etc.).

**How it works:** Most countries use **progressive taxation** — higher income is taxed at higher rates. This means your first €10,000 might be taxed at 0-20%, while income above €50,000 might be taxed at 40%+.

**Typical range:** 10-45% of gross income, depending on total earnings and jurisdiction.

---

### 2. Social Insurance / National Insurance (PRSI, etc.)

**What it is:** Contributions to social security systems that fund unemployment benefits, disability support, and state pension.

**How it works:** Usually a flat percentage of gross income, sometimes with a cap.

**Typical range:** 4-12% of gross income.

---

### 3. Universal Social Charge (USC) / Additional Levies

**What it is:** Additional surcharges applied in some countries (e.g., Ireland's USC) to raise government revenue. Not universal — some countries don't have this.

**How it works:** Often a small percentage applied to most or all income.

**Typical range:** 0-8% where applicable (many countries: 0%).

---

### 4. Pension Contributions (Employee Share)

**What it is:** Your contribution to an employer pension scheme or mandatory retirement fund.

**How it works:** A percentage of your gross salary is deducted and placed into a pension fund. This money isn't lost — it's yours in retirement — but it reduces current take-home.

**Typical range:** 3-10% of gross income (varies by employer and scheme).

### Table 1.2.3-A — Illustrative Deductions Breakdown (€35,000 Gross)

| Deduction | Amount | % of Gross | What It Funds |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Gross Salary** | €35,000 | 100% | — |
| Income Tax | -€5,200 | 14.9% | Public services |
| Social Insurance (PRSI) | -€1,400 | 4.0% | Unemployment, disability, state pension |
| USC / Levies | -€1,020 | 2.9% | General government revenue |
| Pension (Employee) | -€1,750 | 5.0% | Your future retirement |
| **Net Take-Home** | **€25,630** | **73.2%** | Money you can actually spend |

> **Critical Reminder:** These figures are illustrative. Actual deduction rates vary enormously by country, region, income level, personal circumstances (dependants, tax credits, etc.), and employment type. You must check your own country's tax system and your specific payslip.

## 03 — How Progressive Taxation Changes Your Take-Home Percentage

One of the most important concepts in understanding net vs. gross is **progressive taxation** — the principle that higher earners pay a higher percentage of their income in tax.

![Take-Home Percentage Across Income Levels](chart_1_2_3_v2_B_takehome_by_income.png)
*Figure 1.2.3-B — As gross salary increases, net take-home percentage decreases due to progressive tax rates. Low earners keep 80-85%; high earners keep 55-65%. Illustrative rates based on typical EU systems.*

### Why This Matters

**At €30,000 gross:** You might keep 78% (€23,400 net)
**At €60,000 gross:** You might keep 68% (€40,800 net)
**At €100,000 gross:** You might keep 61% (€61,000 net)

This means doubling your gross salary does **not** double your net income. €60,000 gross is not "twice as good" as €30,000 gross in terms of actual spending power — it's 1.74× better.

### Table 1.2.3-B — Gross to Net Across Income Levels

| Gross Annual Salary | Approx. Net (Illustrative) | Take-Home % | Extra €10k Gross = Extra Net |
|---|---|---|---|
| €20,000 | €16,400 | 82% | €8,000 |
| €30,000 | €23,400 | 78% | €7,400 |
| €40,000 | €29,600 | 74% | €6,800 |
| €50,000 | €35,500 | 71% | €6,500 |
| €60,000 | €40,800 | 68% | €6,200 |
| €80,000 | €51,200 | 64% | €5,800 |
| €100,000 | €61,000 | 61% | €5,500 |

**Key insight:** An extra €10,000 in gross salary delivers progressively less in net income as you move up the income scale — €8,000 net at low income, €5,500 net at high income.

## 04 — The Budgeting Disaster: Using Gross Instead of Net

The most expensive mistake in personal finance is building a budget based on gross salary instead of net.

![The Most Expensive Budgeting Mistake: Using Gross Instead of Net](chart_1_2_3_v2_D_budgeting_mistake.png)
*Figure 1.2.3-D — Left: Budget planned on €35k gross (€2,917/month). Right: Budget correctly planned on €25,630 net (€2,136/month). The first creates a €781/month shortfall — every single month.*

### The Scenario

You accept a job offer at €35,000/year. You calculate:

€35,000 ÷ 12 = €2,917 per month

You build a budget:
- Rent: €850
- Food: €400
- Transport: €200
- Bills: €300
- Discretionary: €800
- **Total: €2,550** — well within your €2,917 "income"

Then your first paycheck arrives: **€2,136.**

You're short €781 this month. And next month. And every month. That's €9,372/year — a full 27% shortfall between what you planned and reality.

### The Fix

**Always, always, always budget on net.** When calculating monthly income, use:

**Net Annual ÷ 12** (if paid monthly)
or
**Actual net paycheck amount** (if paid bi-weekly or weekly)

For €35,000 gross with approximately €25,630 net:

€25,630 ÷ 12 = €2,136 per month

Now build a budget that totals **€2,136 or less.**

---

## 05 — Calculating Your Own Net Income

Until you receive your first paycheck, you can estimate net income using online calculators or rough percentages.

### Method 1: Use a Tax Calculator (Recommended)

Search for "[your country] salary calculator" or "take-home pay calculator."

Examples:
- **Ireland:** revenue.ie or deloitte.ie salary calculator
- **UK:** gov.uk tax calculator
- **Germany:** brutto-netto-rechner
- **France:** salaire-brut-net.fr

Enter your gross salary, and the calculator will show approximate net after all deductions.

---

### Method 2: Use Rough Percentage Estimates

If no calculator is available, use these rough benchmarks (based on typical EU systems):

| Gross Annual Salary | Rough Net % | Calculation Example |
|---|---|---|
| €15,000-25,000 | 78-82% | €20,000 × 0.80 = €16,000 net |
| €25,000-40,000 | 73-78% | €30,000 × 0.75 = €22,500 net |
| €40,000-60,000 | 68-73% | €50,000 × 0.70 = €35,000 net |
| €60,000-100,000 | 61-68% | €80,000 × 0.65 = €52,000 net |
| €100,000+ | 55-61% | €120,000 × 0.58 = €69,600 net |

**Important:** These are rough estimates only. Actual rates depend on your specific country, region, and circumstances. Always verify with a proper calculator or your actual payslip.

## 06 — Comparing Job Offers: Always Use Net

When choosing between job offers, comparing gross salaries is misleading — especially if the jobs are in different locations with different tax rates.

### Table 1.2.3-C — Job Offer Comparison (Must Use Net)

| Factor | Job A (Dublin) | Job B (Berlin) | Winner (Headline) | Winner (Reality) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Gross Salary** | €42,000 | €38,000 | Job A (+€4,000) | — |
| **Approx. Net** | €30,660 (73%) | €27,360 (72%) | Job A (+€3,300) | — |
| **Monthly Rent** | €1,400 | €900 | — | Job B (+€500/month) |
| **Net After Rent** | €1,155/mo | €1,380/mo | — | Job B (+€225/month) |

**Headline comparison:** Job A pays €4,000/year more (gross).

**Reality:** After tax and rent, Job B leaves you with €225/month more — €2,700/year better off.

**The lesson:** Always compare net income and adjust for cost of living. Gross salary tells you almost nothing about which job leaves you financially better off.

## 07 — What Happens to the Deducted Money?

It's easy to feel frustrated about deductions — "the government is taking 27% of my salary!" But understanding where deductions go can shift perspective.

### Table 1.2.3-D — Where Your Deductions Go

| Deduction | What It Funds | Benefit to You |
|---|---|---|
| **Income Tax** | Healthcare, education, roads, police, courts, public services | Free/subsidised healthcare, public schools, infrastructure |
| **Social Insurance** | Unemployment benefit, disability support, state pension | Safety net if you lose your job; pension when you retire |
| **USC / Levies** | General government revenue | Funds public services (as above) |
| **Pension (Employee)** | Your personal retirement fund | This is your money — just locked until retirement |

The pension contribution is particularly important to understand: **it's not a tax.** It's forced saving for your future self. The money is yours — you just can't access it until retirement age.

> **Note — Opt-Out Pension Contributions Carefully:** Some employers allow you to opt out of pension contributions to increase take-home pay today. This is almost always a mistake. Employer pensions usually include **employer matching** — if you contribute 5%, they contribute 5%. Opting out means refusing free money. The only exception: if you're in serious financial crisis and need every euro to survive today.

## 08 — Real-World Examples

### Example 1 — The €781 Shortfall

> *"Kayla accepted her first job at €28,000. She was thrilled. She calculated she'd have €2,333/month and immediately rented a €900 apartment. Her first paycheck: €1,820. She was short €513/month — every month. She couldn't pay rent. She had to borrow from family, then eventually moved back home temporarily. The entire crisis was caused by budgeting on gross instead of net. One calculation error cost her her independence for six months."*

**The lesson:** Always budget on net. Always. Check a salary calculator before signing a lease or making any financial commitments.

---

### Example 2 — The Job Offer Mirage

> *"Liam had two offers: Company A in Dublin (€45,000 gross) and Company B in Porto (€35,000 gross). He nearly took Company A because €45k > €35k. Then he calculated: Company A net: ~€32,850. Rent in Dublin: €1,500/month. Net after rent: €1,237/month. Company B net: ~€26,250 (lower Portuguese tax). Rent in Porto: €700/month. Net after rent: €1,487/month. Company B left him €250/month better off despite a €10,000 lower gross salary."*

**The lesson:** Gross salary is almost meaningless without knowing (1) net after tax and (2) cost of living. Always calculate both.

---

### Example 3 — The Pension Opt-Out Mistake

> *"Sophie's employer offered a pension scheme: employee contributes 5% (€1,500/year on €30,000 salary), employer matches 5% (€1,500). Sophie opted out to increase her take-home by €1,500/year. What she didn't realise: she was refusing €1,500 in free employer contributions. Her decision cost her €1,500/year in lost employer money — plus decades of compound growth on €3,000/year contributions. At 6% growth over 30 years, this single decision cost her approximately €237,000 in retirement funds."*

**The lesson:** Almost never opt out of employer pension schemes. The employer match is free money. Refusing it is one of the most expensive financial mistakes you can make.

## Lesson Summary

- **Gross income** is the headline salary; **net income** is what actually arrives in your account after deductions
- Typical deductions: **income tax, social insurance, USC/levies, pension contributions** — totalling 20-45% of gross
- **Progressive taxation** means higher earners keep a smaller percentage — €30k gross = 78% net; €100k gross = 61% net
- **The #1 budgeting mistake:** Planning on gross instead of net creates enormous monthly shortfalls — always budget on net
- **€35,000 gross ≠ €2,917/month** — it's approximately €2,136/month (after typical deductions)
- **Comparing job offers:** Always calculate net income and adjust for cost of living — gross salary alone is misleading
- Use **online salary calculators** for your country to estimate net before accepting offers or making commitments
- **Pension contributions are not taxes** — they're forced savings for your future; employer matching is free money
