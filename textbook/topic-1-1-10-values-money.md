## 01 — What Are Values (and Why Do They Matter)?

You've learned about needs vs. wants (1.1.2), impulse spending (1.1.3), emotional triggers (1.1.7), and psychological tactics (1.1.8). But there's a deeper question underlying all financial decisions: **what actually matters to you?**

Most people spend money based on:
- **What they think they should want** (social pressure, advertising)
- **What feels good right now** (impulse, dopamine)
- **What they've always done** (habit, autopilot)

Very few people spend based on what they genuinely, deeply value. And that misalignment is the source of enormous financial regret.

> **Definition:** Values are the principles, qualities, and experiences that matter most to you — what makes life feel meaningful and worthwhile. In a financial context, values are the north star that should guide where your money goes.

When your spending aligns with your values, purchases bring lasting satisfaction — even if they're expensive. When your spending conflicts with your values, purchases bring regret — even if they were cheap.

![Values-Aligned vs. Misaligned Spending: Satisfaction Over Time](chart_1_1_10_A_satisfaction_comparison.png)
*Figure 1.1.10-A — Values-aligned purchases maintain satisfaction over time and have high repeat-purchase rates. Misaligned purchases lose appeal within days. Based on consumer psychology research.*

> **Note — Values Aren't Morals:** This lesson isn't about what you "should" value or moral judgments. If status genuinely matters to you, that's a valid value. If pleasure and comfort matter, those are valid values. The goal isn't to change your values to match some ideal — it's to become conscious of what they actually are, so you can align your money with them instead of fighting against them.

## 02 — Common Core Values (and How to Find Yours)

Most people have never consciously identified their core values. They operate on autopilot, spending money based on vague impulses and social pressures rather than clear principles.

![12 Common Core Values](chart_1_1_10_B_core_values.png)
*Figure 1.1.10-B — Twelve common core values that frequently drive financial decisions. Your top 3-5 will be your financial compass.*

### The 12 Values Explained

**Security** — Stability, safety, financial protection, insurance against disaster
**Freedom** — Autonomy, flexibility, independence, not being tied down
**Growth** — Learning, development, skill-building, becoming better
**Family** — Time with loved ones, supporting family, creating memories
**Adventure** — Experiences, travel, new things, spontaneity
**Achievement** — Success, recognition, accomplishment, reaching goals
**Community** — Belonging, connection, relationships, social ties
**Health** — Wellbeing, fitness, vitality, longevity
**Creativity** — Expression, art, making things, originality
**Generosity** — Giving, helping, contributing, making impact
**Status** — Recognition, respect, appearance, social position
**Pleasure** — Enjoyment, comfort, indulgence, sensory satisfaction

### How to Identify Your Top Values

### Table 1.1.10-A — The Values Identification Exercise

| Step | What To Do | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Rate all 12** | Score each value 1-10 based on how much it matters to you | Security: 9, Freedom: 8, Status: 3... |
| **2. Pick top 5** | Select the 5 highest-scoring values | Security, Freedom, Family, Growth, Health |
| **3. Force-rank them** | Put them in order — which matters most? | 1. Family, 2. Security, 3. Freedom, 4. Health, 5. Growth |
| **4. Test with past spending** | Look at recent purchases — do they align with your top 3? | Spent €300 on family holiday (✓), €200 on status clothes (✗) |
| **5. Test with future choices** | Use an upcoming decision — which value does each option serve? | New job: more money (security) vs. flexible hours (freedom)? |

Most people find their top 3 values drive 80%+ of their happiest financial decisions. Everything else is noise.

> **Note — Your Values Will Evolve:** The values that mattered at age 18 may not matter at 28 or 48. Family often rises in priority when you have children. Freedom often rises when you've been trapped in rigid jobs. Security often rises after financial crisis. This isn't flip-flopping — it's growth. Revisit your values every 2-3 years.

## 03 — Why Misalignment Creates Regret

When your spending conflicts with your values, three things happen:

### 1. Immediate Satisfaction, Rapid Decline

Values-misaligned purchases feel good in the moment (dopamine hit) but lose appeal within days or weeks. You bought something expensive to impress others (status), but status isn't actually one of your core values — so the item becomes a source of guilt, not pride.

### 2. Cognitive Dissonance

Your brain notices the mismatch between what you say matters and where your money actually goes. This creates psychological discomfort. You claim family is your top value but spend more on gadgets than family experiences. The dissonance erodes self-trust.

### 3. Opportunity Cost Regret

Every euro spent on something misaligned is a euro you didn't spend on something aligned. You spent €500 on clothes you barely wear (status) instead of €500 on a family trip (family). Six months later, you'd trade the clothes for the trip — but the money is gone.

### Table 1.1.10-B — Regret Patterns by Misalignment Type

| Misalignment Type | Example | Why You Bought It | Why You Regret It | Typical Regret Timeline |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Social pressure** | Expensive restaurant to impress friends | FOMO, keeping up | Doesn't align with your values; you'd rather save | 1-2 weeks |
| **Impulse habit** | Daily coffee + pastry (€8) | Autopilot, convenience | Adds up; doesn't bring joy | 1 month (when you see total) |
| **Status seeking** | Designer item when status isn't your value | Marketing, comparison | Feels hollow; no one cares | 2-4 weeks |
| **Emotional soothing** | Retail therapy purchase | Stress, sadness | Doesn't solve problem; adds guilt | 1-3 days |
| **Fake urgency** | "Sale ends tonight" for unneeded item | Scarcity pressure, FOMO | Never used it | Immediately upon arrival |

> **Note — Small Misalignments Add Up:** It's not just the big purchases. It's the accumulated weight of hundreds of small decisions that drift away from what matters. €8/day on coffee you don't really enjoy = €2,920/year that could have funded your top value (e.g., travel, family experiences, financial security). Death by a thousand cuts.

## 04 — The Value-Money Alignment Matrix

To make better decisions, you need a framework. The **Value-Money Alignment Matrix** sorts spending into four quadrants based on two dimensions: cost and alignment with values.

![The Value-Money Alignment Matrix](chart_1_1_10_C_alignment_matrix.png)
*Figure 1.1.10-C — The 2×2 matrix showing four types of spending. Goal: maximize Best and Intentional quadrants, minimize Worst and Neutral.*

### The Four Quadrants

### Quadrant 1: WORST (High Cost + Misaligned)

**What it is:** Expensive purchases that don't align with your core values.

**Examples:**
- Bought an expensive car to impress others, but status isn't your value
- Expensive gym membership you never use (health isn't actually your priority)
- Keeping up with friends' luxury holidays when you prefer quiet time

**What to do:** Eliminate or drastically reduce. These are the biggest regret generators.

---

### Quadrant 2: INTENTIONAL (High Cost + Aligned)

**What it is:** Expensive purchases that deeply align with your top values.

**Examples:**
- €2,000 family holiday when family is your #1 value
- €800 course to learn a skill when growth is your top value
- €3,000 spent creating a home office when freedom/autonomy is your value

**What to do:** These are your **guilt-free spending zones.** Spend generously here without apology. These purchases bring lasting satisfaction.

---

### Quadrant 3: NEUTRAL (Low Cost + Misaligned)

**What it is:** Small purchases that don't align, but aren't expensive enough to cause major damage.

**Examples:**
- €3 impulse snack at checkout
- €8 small item you bought out of boredom
- €15 low-quality gadget

**What to do:** Minimize but don't obsess. These are "spending leaks" — worth plugging, but not catastrophic.

---

### Quadrant 4: BEST (Low Cost + Aligned)

**What it is:** Low-cost or free activities that deeply align with your values.

**Examples:**
- Free walks in nature (if health/peace is your value)
- Cooking family meals at home (if family is your value)
- Library books on topics you love (if growth is your value)

**What to do:** Maximize these. This is the **highest ROI spending** — maximum satisfaction per euro. Identify what falls in this quadrant for you and do more of it.

### Table 1.1.10-C — Where to Spend Your Time and Money

| Quadrant | Priority | Action | Example Shifts |
|---|---|---|---|
| **WORST** (High cost + misaligned) | Eliminate | Cut ruthlessly | Cancel unused subscriptions, stop status purchases |
| **INTENTIONAL** (High cost + aligned) | Spend freely | Increase without guilt | Plan annual family trip, invest in learning |
| **NEUTRAL** (Low cost + misaligned) | Reduce | Minimize waste | Skip impulse checkout items, unsubscribe from marketing |
| **BEST** (Low cost + aligned) | Maximize | Do more of this | Schedule free/cheap activities aligned with values |

## 05 — Values-Based Spending in Practice

Understanding the matrix is useful. Applying it is transformative. Here's how values-based spending changes real decisions:

### Table 1.1.10-D — Values-Based Decision Framework

| Decision | Traditional Thinking | Values-Based Thinking | Likely Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Weekend plans** | "What's everyone else doing?" | "Which option aligns with my top values?" | Higher satisfaction, less FOMO |
| **Job offer** | "Which pays more?" | "Which better serves my top 2-3 values?" | Better long-term fit |
| **Buying clothes** | "Is this on sale? Do I like it?" | "Does this serve a value (e.g., professional success, comfort)?" | Less clutter, less regret |
| **Holiday decision** | "Where's Instagram-worthy?" | "What kind of experience aligns with my values?" | Deeper memories |
| **Subscription renewal** | "It's only €10/month" | "Does this serve a value? What's annual cost?" | Less waste, more alignment |
| **Gift purchase** | "What's appropriate for this price range?" | "What would meaningfully reflect their values?" | Better relationships |

### How to Apply It

**Before any non-essential purchase over €50:**

1. **Pause** — Don't buy immediately
2. **Identify the value** — Which of my top 3 values does this serve?
3. **If none** — This is misaligned. Walk away or find a cheaper version.
4. **If one or more** — Check if it's the best way to serve that value. If yes, buy guilt-free.

## 06 — The Spending Shift: Before and After

When people shift from typical spending to values-based spending (same income, different allocation), the changes are dramatic.

![How Values-Based Spending Shifts Where Your Money Goes](chart_1_1_10_D_spending_shift.png)
*Figure 1.1.10-D — Typical spending vs. values-based spending for the same annual income. Values-based budgeting nearly triples spending on aligned priorities.*

### What Changes

**Typical spending pattern:**
- 18% on things aligned with top values
- 60% on things misaligned (social pressure, impulse, habit)
- 22% on neutral necessities

**Values-based spending pattern:**
- 52% on things aligned with top values
- 20% on things misaligned (reduced but not eliminated)
- 28% on neutral necessities

Notice: Values-based spending doesn't eliminate all misaligned spending (that's unrealistic). It reduces it by two-thirds and redirects that money to what actually matters.

### Real Impact

For someone earning €30,000/year with €24,000 in spending:

| Category | Typical Annual | Values-Based Annual | Shift |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Aligned with values** | €4,320 | €12,480 | +€8,160 |
| **Misaligned** | €14,400 | €4,800 | -€9,600 |
| **Neutral** | €5,280 | €6,720 | +€1,440 |

By cutting misaligned spending and reinvesting it in aligned spending, you nearly triple the money going to what actually matters to you — without earning a single euro more.

> **Note — This Isn't Deprivation:** Values-based spending doesn't mean never spending on pleasure or comfort. If pleasure is one of your top values, you should spend generously on it — guilt-free. The key is consciousness: spend on what you've *chosen* to value, not what advertising or peers pressure you into.

## 07 — Real-World Examples

### Example 1 — Clara's €200/Month Coffee Habit

> *"Clara, 26, was spending €200/month at coffee shops — €6/day on coffee + pastry. She claimed 'community' and 'growth' as her top values. But the coffee shop trips were solo, rushed, and routine. She wasn't connecting with anyone or learning anything. It was just expensive caffeine. When she mapped her spending to her values, she realised: €0 of that €200 served her actual priorities."*

Clara's shift: Cut coffee shop to 2x/week (€50/month). Redirected €150/month to:
- €60/month coworking space membership (community: met 4 new friends)
- €90/month online courses (growth: learned graphic design, increased freelance rates)

Same money. Completely different satisfaction. Six months later, she reported the coworking and courses were among her best financial decisions ever. The daily coffee? She barely remembered it.

**The lesson:** High-frequency, low-consciousness spending is almost always misaligned. Audit your autopilot habits.

---

### Example 2 — The Tale of Two Holidays

> *"Two friends, both earning €35k/year, both took €1,500 holidays. Friend A went to an Instagram-famous destination because everyone was posting it — but she's an introvert who values quiet and nature, not social validation. Friend B went hiking in rural Scotland — fewer photos, but deeply aligned with her values (adventure, nature, solitude). One year later: Friend A barely remembers the trip and regrets the cost. Friend B calls it one of the best experiences of her life."*

Same money. Radically different outcomes. The difference was values alignment.

**The lesson:** Expensive purchases aren't the problem. Expensive misaligned purchases are the problem.

---

### Example 3 — The Career Decision

> *"Marcus had two job offers: Company A: €52k/year, 50-hour weeks, prestigious brand. Company B: €45k/year, 35-hour weeks, flexible remote work. Traditional advice: take the higher salary. But Marcus's top values were: 1. Family (young kids), 2. Health (recovering from burnout), 3. Freedom. He took Company B. Five years later: his health recovered, his relationship with his kids is strong, and he has time for hobbies. Company A would have paid €35k more over 5 years — but destroyed the things he actually valued."*

Money is a tool to serve your values. Sometimes more money serves them. Sometimes it doesn't.

**The lesson:** The highest-paying option is only the best option if income maximization is your top value.

## 08 — Building Your Values-Driven Spending Plan

Here's a simple 4-step process to start aligning your spending with your values:

### Table 1.1.10-E — Your 30-Day Values Alignment Plan

| Week | Task | Time Required | What You'll Learn |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Week 1** | Complete values identification exercise (rank top 5) | 20 minutes | What actually matters to you |
| **Week 2** | Review last month's spending; categorize each item by alignment | 45 minutes | Where misalignment is costing you |
| **Week 3** | Identify 3 misaligned expenses to cut + 3 aligned areas to increase | 30 minutes | Specific shifts to make |
| **Week 4** | Implement changes; track how satisfaction shifts | Ongoing | Whether this framework works for you |

### After 30 Days

Most people report:
- **Reduced financial guilt** — spending on aligned priorities feels good, not indulgent
- **Easier to say no** — if something doesn't serve your values, declining is simple
- **More satisfaction per euro** — same income, higher life quality
- **Clearer financial goals** — values clarify what you're saving *for*

---

## Lesson Summary

- **Values** are the principles and experiences that matter most to you — they should guide where money goes
- **Values-aligned spending** produces lasting satisfaction; misaligned spending creates regret within days/weeks
- Most people spend based on social pressure, impulse, or habit — not values — leading to chronic dissatisfaction
- The **Value-Money Alignment Matrix** has four quadrants: Best (low cost + aligned), Intentional (high cost + aligned), Neutral (low cost + misaligned), Worst (high cost + misaligned)
- **Goal:** Maximize Best and Intentional quadrants, minimize Worst and Neutral
- **Values-based spending** nearly triples the share of income going to aligned priorities (52% vs 18%) by cutting misaligned spending
- Common core values: Security, Freedom, Growth, Family, Adventure, Achievement, Community, Health, Creativity, Generosity, Status, Pleasure
- **30-day plan:** Identify values → audit spending → cut 3 misaligned items → increase 3 aligned areas → track satisfaction
- This isn't deprivation — it's **conscious allocation** toward what genuinely matters to you
