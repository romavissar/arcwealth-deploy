## 01 — Salaries Are Not Random

When people accept a salary, they often treat it as if the employer picked a number from the air — and accepting it is simply the polite thing to do. It isn't. Salaries are determined by specific, identifiable forces — and understanding them gives you real leverage.

> **Definition:** A salary is a form of periodic compensation paid to an employee in exchange for work. It is set at the intersection of market forces, organisational structures, and individual negotiation — all of which you can research, understand, and influence.

Most people dramatically underestimate how much variation exists in salary for similar work — and how much of that variation they can affect through deliberate choices about where they work, what skills they build, and how they negotiate.

> **Note — You Are Not Paid What You're Worth:** A phrase you'll often hear is "employees are paid what they're worth." This isn't accurate. You are paid what the market thinks you're worth, *filtered through what your employer thinks they can get away with.* Your actual value — as a human being, as a professional — is not captured in a salary figure. Understanding salary-setting as a market mechanism, rather than a moral judgement, helps you engage with it more strategically.

## 02 — The Eight Forces That Shape Your Salary

No single factor determines salary. It's the interaction of multiple forces.

![What Determines Your Salary?](chart_1_2_3_A_salary_determinants.png)
*Figure 1.2.3-A — The eight major forces that determine salary, shown by relative influence. Industry/sector and supply/demand are the two dominant forces — outweighing qualifications or experience for most roles.*

### The Eight Forces Explained

### 1. Industry and Sector (Very High Influence)

The single biggest determinant of salary for most roles. The same fundamental skill set — analytical thinking, communication, project management, technical knowledge — earns radically different amounts depending on the industry it's applied in.

A marketing professional in financial services earns far more than a marketing professional in the charity sector — not because their work is better, but because financial services generates enormous revenue per employee.

**Rule of thumb:** In high-revenue-per-employee industries (finance, tech, law, consulting), there is more money available to share with employees. In low-revenue-per-employee industries (retail, hospitality, non-profit), there is less.

---

### 2. Supply and Demand (Very High Influence)

When a skill is rare relative to demand, employers must pay more to attract people with it. When a skill is common, employers can afford to pay less.

This is straightforward economics — and it's one of the most actionable insights in this lesson. You have partial control over which skills you build. Building scarce, in-demand skills is one of the highest-leverage salary moves available to you.

---

### 3. Location and Geography (High Influence)

Salaries in major cities are typically 20-40% higher than equivalent roles in smaller cities or rural areas — reflecting higher living costs and greater competition for talent.

International differences can be extreme: the same software engineering role might pay €45,000 in Ireland, €80,000 in Germany, and €180,000 in San Francisco — for identical work.

---

### 4. Experience and Seniority (High Influence)

More years of relevant, demonstrated experience commands higher pay — but this relationship is not linear. Experience matters most in the early career stages (0-5 years). After that, the quality and specificity of experience matters more than years alone.

---

### 5. Company Size and Stage (High Influence)

Large, established companies typically pay higher base salaries but offer less equity upside. Early-stage startups often pay below market in base salary but compensate with equity (shares) that could become valuable — or worthless.

---

### 6. Negotiation Skill (Moderate Influence)

For identical roles and identical candidates, salary outcomes routinely differ by 10-20% based purely on negotiation skill. We cover this in full in Lesson 1.2.4 — Salary Negotiation.

---

### 7. Education and Credentials (Moderate Influence)

Certain credentials unlock certain salary floors — professional qualifications in law, medicine, and accountancy being the clearest examples. For many roles, however, demonstrated skills and experience are weighted equally or more than formal qualifications.

**Important:** The salary premium of a degree varies enormously by field. A degree in computer science or medicine has substantial, documentable salary returns. A degree in many humanities fields has returns that are modest relative to the cost.

---

### 8. Economic Conditions (Moderate Influence)

Labour markets tighten and loosen with economic cycles. In boom periods, competition for talent pushes salaries up. In recessions, employer leverage increases and salaries stagnate or fall. This is largely outside your control — but timing a job change to a tight market can yield significantly better offers.

---

## 03 — Industry Is the Multiplier

Of all the factors above, industry choice has the highest leverage on lifetime earnings for most people — because it multiplies every other factor.

![Same Role, Different Industry: How Sector Shapes Salary](chart_1_2_3_B_salary_by_industry.png)
*Figure 1.2.3-B — Typical salary range for a mid-level professional with 5 years of experience, across eight industries. The same skills and experience can earn EUR28k in retail or EUR115k in big tech — a 4x difference. Illustrative ranges.*

### The Range Is Dramatic

Look at the chart. For a mid-level professional with five years of experience, the typical salary range spans from roughly EUR28,000-42,000 in retail/hospitality to EUR72,000-115,000 in big tech — for work that, in many cases, requires comparable skills.

### Table 1.2.3-A — Industry Salary Multiplier (Relative to Median)

| Industry | Relative Salary Level | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Big Tech** | 2.5-3× median | Enormous revenue per employee; global talent competition |
| **Finance / Banking** | 2-2.5× median | High-value transactions; profit-sharing culture; bonus structures |
| **Legal / Professional Services** | 1.8-2× median | High billing rates passed through to staff salaries |
| **Healthcare (clinical)** | 1.2-1.6× median | Regulated profession; specialisation premium |
| **Government / Public sector** | 1-1.2× median | Stable, with pension, but below private sector |
| **Education** | 0.9-1.1× median | Intrinsic rewards compensate for below-market pay |
| **Retail / Hospitality** | 0.5-0.7× median | Low revenue per employee; highly commoditised labour |
| **Non-Profit** | 0.7-0.9× median | Mission-driven; limited revenue to distribute |

> **Note — Industry Doesn't Trap You:** Choosing a low-paying industry now doesn't mean staying there. Skills developed in one sector are often transferable to higher-paying ones. Many professionals begin in non-profit, education, or public sector — building skills and experience — then transition to private sector later for higher compensation. The transition requires deliberate planning but is very achievable.

## 04 — How Supply and Demand Drive Pay

Every skill sits somewhere on the spectrum from "widely available" to "extremely rare." The rarer a skill relative to demand, the higher its price.

![Supply & Demand: How Skill Scarcity Drives Salary](chart_1_2_3_D_supply_demand_salary.png)
*Figure 1.2.3-D — The relationship between skill supply (horizontal) and typical salary (vertical). Rarer skills command dramatically higher compensation. Bubble size represents demand. Illustrative positioning.*

### The Strategic Implication

You can deliberately move yourself leftward on this chart — toward greater scarcity — by building specialised skills that fewer people have. This is the highest-leverage move available to someone early in their career.

### Table 1.2.3-B — Skill Scarcity and Salary Examples

| Skill Category | Supply Level | Typical Salary Range | Time to Develop |
|---|---|---|---|
| General administration | Very common | EUR25k-35k | Weeks |
| Project management | Common | EUR45k-70k | 1-2 years |
| Data analysis | Moderate | EUR55k-80k | 1-2 years |
| Software engineering | Moderate-scarce | EUR65k-110k | 2-4 years |
| Machine learning / AI | Scarce | EUR90k-140k | 3-5 years |
| Cyber security | Scarce | EUR80k-130k | 2-4 years |
| Cardiac surgery | Very rare | EUR150k-250k | 12+ years |
| Patent attorney | Very rare | EUR120k-180k | 7-10 years |

### The Skill Investment Principle

Building a rare, high-demand skill takes time and effort — but the return on that investment compounds over an entire career. Someone who spends 18 months learning software engineering at age 22 might earn EUR20,000 more per year from age 24 onward. That's EUR800,000+ in extra earnings over a 40-year career — from an 18-month investment.

## 05 — Salary Bands: How Pay Is Structured Inside Organisations

Most organisations don't simply pick individual salaries. They use **salary bands** — structured pay ranges for each level or role — to ensure consistency and manage costs.

![How Salary Bands Work Inside Organisations](chart_1_2_3_C_salary_bands.png)
*Figure 1.2.3-C — Typical salary band structure showing floor, ceiling, and midpoint for six career levels. Bands overlap — a top-of-band L2 can earn more than a bottom-of-band L3. Illustrative structure.*

### Understanding the Band Structure

**Floor (minimum):** The lowest the organisation will pay for this level. Usually offered to new hires with no relevant experience.

**Midpoint:** The market rate for a fully effective person at this level. What someone with solid experience should earn.

**Ceiling (maximum):** The highest the organisation pays at this level. Requires exceptional performance or very long tenure. Once you hit the ceiling, the only way to earn more is promotion to the next band.

**Band overlap:** Bands intentionally overlap. This means a highly experienced person at Level 2 can earn more than a newly promoted person at Level 3 — which avoids cliff-edge pay jumps and allows retention of strong performers.

### Table 1.2.3-C — Where to Aim Within a Band

| Your Situation | Target Band Position | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **New hire, no relevant experience** | Floor to 25th percentile | Employer is investing in training |
| **Some relevant experience** | 25th-50th percentile | You can do the job; still developing |
| **Solid experience, proven performer** | 50th-75th percentile | You deliver consistently; market-competitive |
| **Top performer, hard to replace** | 75th-90th percentile | Premium for talent retention |
| **At ceiling, ready for promotion** | Ceiling | Signal that band has been outgrown |

### How to Use This Knowledge

**Before applying:** Research the band range using salary comparison sites (Glassdoor, LinkedIn Salary, Levels.fyi for tech). Know where the midpoint is before any interview.

**When given an offer:** If offered at the floor, you have room to negotiate. "Based on my [X] years of experience and [Y] specific skills, I'd expect to be closer to the midpoint of the band — is EUR[X] achievable?"

**Mid-employment:** If you've been in a role for 2+ years and are performing well but are still at the low end of the band, you have a strong case for a salary review. Document your performance and request it formally.

---

## 06 — The Transparency Gap: What Employers Know That You Don't

One of the most significant salary dynamics is the **information asymmetry** between employers and employees.

Employers typically know:
- The full salary band for every role
- What everyone in the team earns
- What they'd pay to replace you
- What you told them in interviews about your current salary

Employees typically know:
- What they currently earn
- What they were offered at this job
- Vague rumours about colleagues' salaries

This information gap systematically benefits employers in salary negotiations. The antidote is research.

### Table 1.2.3-D — Salary Research Sources

| Source | What It Gives You | Reliability |
|---|---|---|
| **Glassdoor** | Reported salaries by company and role | Moderate — self-reported, can be outdated |
| **LinkedIn Salary** | Salary data aggregated from profiles | Moderate-good — large dataset |
| **Levels.fyi** | Detailed tech industry compensation | Very good — verified submissions |
| **Payscale** | Role + experience + location salary data | Good for benchmarking ranges |
| **Recruitment agencies** | Current market rates for active roles | Excellent — reflects live market |
| **Job adverts** | Advertised salary ranges | Good — some countries mandate disclosure |
| **Talking to peers** | What people actually earn | Excellent but socially awkward — increasingly normalised |

> **Note — Salary Transparency Is Growing:** The EU Pay Transparency Directive (2023) will require organisations to disclose pay ranges in job adverts across EU member states by 2026. Several US states have already mandated this. This is gradually closing the information asymmetry — and is one of the most significant labour market changes of the decade. Always check whether roles you're applying for are in jurisdictions requiring pay disclosure.

## 07 — The Lifetime Salary Effect

Small salary differences early in a career compound dramatically over time. This is because most future raises are calculated as a percentage of current salary.

### Table 1.2.3-E — How a EUR5,000 Starting Difference Compounds

| Scenario | Starting Salary | After 10 Years (3% annual growth) | After 20 Years | After 30 Years |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Negotiated well** | EUR45,000 | EUR60,452 | EUR81,217 | EUR109,136 |
| **Accepted offer** | EUR40,000 | EUR53,757 | EUR72,193 | EUR97,021 |
| **Cumulative difference** | EUR5,000/yr | EUR6,695/yr | EUR9,024/yr | EUR12,115/yr |
| **Total earnings gap** | — | EUR67,000 over 10yr | EUR270,000 over 20yr | EUR636,000 over 30yr |

A EUR5,000 salary difference at age 22, assuming 3% annual raises, compounds to a **EUR636,000 lifetime earnings difference** by retirement.

This is why salary negotiation — covered in the next lesson — is not a minor or uncomfortable optional extra. It is one of the highest-leverage financial decisions you will ever make.

## 08 — Real-World Examples

### Example 1 — Same Degree, EUR50,000 Difference

> *"Two graduates with identical computer science degrees and identical GPAs enter the job market. Zara researches salary bands, applies to companies in finance and big tech, negotiates her offer, and starts at EUR72,000. Tom applies to the first company that responds, accepts the initial offer without negotiating, and starts at EUR42,000 in a government IT role. Both do similar work. Five years later, with typical progression: Zara earns approximately EUR95,000; Tom earns approximately EUR56,000. The EUR30,000 annual gap is almost entirely explained by industry choice and negotiation, not ability."*

**The lesson:** Where you apply matters more than what you know. Two people with identical skills can have radically different salaries based purely on target industry and negotiation.

---

### Example 2 — The Skill Investment That Changed Everything

> *"Priya was a marketing coordinator earning EUR32,000. She noticed that data analysts in her company earned EUR58,000+. She spent 14 months studying data analysis evenings and weekends (EUR1,200 in course fees). She then applied internally for a data analyst role and was promoted to EUR54,000 — a EUR22,000 raise. Within three years she was earning EUR72,000. The EUR1,200 investment returned EUR22,000 in year one alone — a 1,733% ROI."*

**The lesson:** Moving yourself leftward on the supply/demand curve — building scarcer skills — is the highest-return investment you can make in your earning potential.

---

### Example 3 — Discovering the Band Mid-Employment

> *"Owen had been in his role for three years. He was performing well, received positive reviews, but had received only small annual raises (2-3%). He researched salary bands using Glassdoor and LinkedIn Salary, and discovered his role's midpoint was EUR58,000 — but he was earning EUR48,000. He also discovered two colleagues hired more recently were earning EUR52,000 and EUR55,000. Armed with this data, he requested a salary review meeting. He presented market data showing his salary was 17% below midpoint and outlined his performance contributions. He received a EUR7,000 raise. The entire process took one conversation."*

**The lesson:** Salary research gives you power. Knowing the band, the midpoint, and market rates transforms a vague conversation into a data-driven negotiation. Without research, Owen would have continued accepting 2% raises indefinitely.

## Lesson Summary

- Salaries are set by **eight identifiable forces**: industry/sector, supply/demand, geography, experience, company size, negotiation skill, credentials, and economic conditions
- **Industry is the highest-leverage factor** — the same skills can earn 2-4× more in high-revenue industries (tech, finance) than low-revenue ones (retail, non-profit)
- **Supply and demand** is the second major force — building rare, in-demand skills is one of the highest-return investments you can make
- Organisations use **salary bands** with a floor, midpoint, and ceiling — knowing where you sit gives you evidence for negotiation
- **New hires are typically offered below midpoint** — there is almost always room to negotiate upward
- A **EUR5,000 starting salary difference** compounds to EUR636,000 in lifetime earnings over 30 years — salary negotiation is a major financial decision
- **Information asymmetry** benefits employers — research using Glassdoor, LinkedIn Salary, job adverts, and peer conversations closes the gap
- The EU Pay Transparency Directive will require pay range disclosure in job adverts across member states by 2026
