## 01 — Why Your Payslip Matters

Your payslip (also called pay statement, pay stub, or wage slip) is one of the most important financial documents you receive — yet most people barely glance at it, or ignore it entirely.

This is a costly mistake. Payroll errors are surprisingly common — studies suggest **15-30% of employees experience at least one payroll error per year.** These errors can cost you hundreds or thousands of euros if undetected.

> **Definition — Payslip:** A document provided by your employer each pay period showing your gross pay, all deductions, net pay, and year-to-date totals. It is both a receipt for payment and a record of your earnings and tax contributions.

Your payslip serves three critical functions:

1. **Verification** — Confirms you were paid correctly
2. **Record** — Proves your income (for loans, mortgages, tax returns)
3. **Tax evidence** — Documents what tax you've paid (essential for end-of-year reconciliation)

*Figure 1.2.4-A — Annotated payslip showing the six key sections to check every month: personal info, pay period, gross pay, deductions, net pay, and year-to-date totals.*

## 02 — The Six Key Sections of Every Payslip

While payslip formats vary by employer and country, nearly all contain these six sections:

### Section 1: Personal Information

**What it shows:**
- Your full name
- Employee ID or payroll number
- Department or cost centre
- Sometimes: National Insurance number, tax code

**Why it matters:** Confirms the payslip is actually yours (mix-ups happen, especially in large organisations).

---

### Section 2: Pay Period and Pay Date

**What it shows:**
- The period this payslip covers (e.g., "1-31 January 2026")
- The date payment was made
- Payment method (bank transfer, cheque)

**Why it matters:** You need to match the pay period to the hours you worked or the agreed salary period. If you started mid-month, your first payslip should be pro-rated.

---

### Section 3: Earnings (Gross Pay)

**What it shows:**
- Basic salary or hourly rate × hours worked
- Overtime (if applicable)
- Bonuses, commission, allowances
- **Gross Pay** — total before deductions

**Why it matters:** This is where most errors occur. Check:
- Salary matches your contract
- Hours worked are correct (for waged employees)
- Overtime rate is correct (1.5×, 2×, etc.)
- Any bonuses or allowances you were promised are included

### Table 1.2.4-A — Common Earnings Line Items

| Line Item | What It Means | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Basic Salary/Wage** | Your standard pay | €2,917 (€35k annual ÷ 12) |
| **Overtime** | Hours beyond standard at premium rate | 5 hours × €21.87 = €109.38 |
| **Holiday Pay** | Paid time off (usually built into salary) | Included in basic |
| **Bonus** | Performance bonus, signing bonus | €500 |
| **Allowance** | Travel, phone, meal allowances | €50 |
| **Gross Pay** | **Sum of all earnings** | **€3,026.05** |

---

### Section 4: Deductions

**What it shows:**
- Income tax
- Social insurance (PRSI, National Insurance)
- USC or other levies (country-specific)
- Pension contributions (employee share)
- Any other deductions (union dues, loan repayments, etc.)

**Why it matters:** Errors in deductions — especially tax code errors — can cost you hundreds per month.

### Table 1.2.4-B — Common Deduction Line Items

| Deduction | What It Is | Check For |
|---|---|---|
| **Income Tax** | Tax on earnings | Matches tax code and salary band |
| **PRSI / NI / Social Insurance** | Social security contribution | Correct % (typically 4-12%) |
| **USC / Levies** | Additional government charges | Only if applicable in your country |
| **Pension (Employee)** | Your contribution to pension | Matches agreed % (typically 3-10%) |
| **Student Loan** | Automatic repayment (if applicable) | Only deducted above threshold |
| **Union Dues** | Trade union membership | Only if you're a member |

---

### Section 5: Net Pay (Take-Home)

**What it shows:**
- The final amount after all deductions
- This is what should arrive in your bank account

**Why it matters:** This number must match what actually hit your account. If it doesn't, there's either a payslip error or a banking error — investigate immediately.

---

### Section 6: Year-to-Date (YTD) Totals

**What it shows:**
- Cumulative gross pay for the tax year so far
- Cumulative tax paid
- Cumulative other deductions
- Cumulative net pay

**Why it matters:**
- Needed for tax returns at year-end
- Helps you track total annual earnings
- Reveals if deductions have been wrong for multiple months (errors compound)

---

## 03 — Understanding Tax Codes

One of the most common — and expensive — payslip errors is an incorrect tax code.

**What is a tax code?**
A code assigned by the tax authority that tells your employer how much tax to deduct. It's based on your personal allowances, circumstances, and income.

### Common Tax Code Examples (UK-style system)

| Tax Code | What It Means | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **1250L** | Standard code for single earner, €12,500 tax-free allowance | Correct tax deducted |
| **1250L W1/M1** | Emergency code — ignores cumulative history | Often over-deducts |
| **0T** | No allowances — maximum tax | Severe over-deduction |
| **BR** | Basic rate on all income (20%) | Usually for second jobs |
| **K code (e.g., K500)** | You owe tax from previous years or have benefits | Extra tax deducted |

![How Wrong Tax Code Costs You Money Every Month](chart_1_2_4_v2_C_tax_code_impact.png)
*Figure 1.2.4-C — Comparison of correct tax code (1250L) vs. emergency tax code (0T) on €35,000 salary. Wrong code costs €426/month (€5,112/year). Illustrative UK-style example.*

### What to Do If Your Tax Code Is Wrong

1. **Check your tax code on your payslip** — it's usually near the top or in the deductions section
2. **Compare it to your official tax code notice** — you should have received this from the tax authority
3. **If they don't match:** Contact your employer's payroll department immediately with your tax code notice
4. **If you don't have a tax code notice:** Contact your country's tax authority (HMRC in UK, Revenue in Ireland, etc.) and request one

> **Note — Emergency Tax Codes Are Temporary:** When you start a new job without providing tax documents, you're often put on an emergency tax code (e.g., 0T, W1/M1). This deducts maximum tax. It's meant to be temporary — you should provide your P45 (previous employment document) or tax code notice within the first month to switch to the correct code and get overpaid tax refunded.

## 04 — The Seven Most Common Payslip Errors

![Common Payslip Errors: What to Check Every Month](chart_1_2_4_v2_B_common_errors.png)
*Figure 1.2.4-B — The seven most frequent payroll errors ranked by how often employees experience them. Tax code errors affect 24% of employees at some point.*

### Error 1: Incorrect Tax Code (24% experience this)

**What it looks like:** Tax deducted is much higher than expected, or your code doesn't match your notice.

**Impact:** €200-500/month overpayment.

**Fix:** Contact payroll immediately with your tax code notice.

---

### Error 2: Missing Overtime Hours or Pay (18%)

**What it looks like:** You worked 5 hours overtime but it's not on your payslip, or the rate is wrong.

**Impact:** €50-200 per missing instance.

**Fix:** Check your timesheets/records. Email payroll with evidence of hours worked.

---

### Error 3: Hours Worked Don't Match Records (15%)

**What it looks like:** Payslip shows 35 hours but you worked 40.

**Impact:** €50-150 per week for waged employees.

**Fix:** Keep your own record of hours worked. Compare weekly.

---

### Error 4: Wrong Hourly Rate or Salary (12%)

**What it looks like:** Your contract says €15/hour but payslip shows €14.

**Impact:** Hundreds per month if undetected.

**Fix:** Check first payslip carefully against contract. Alert payroll immediately.

---

### Error 5: Missing Holiday Pay or Bonuses (11%)

**What it looks like:** Your contract promised a €500 Christmas bonus — it's December but no bonus on payslip.

**Impact:** Whatever the missing amount is.

**Fix:** Email payroll referencing the specific clause in your contract.

---

### Error 6: Pension Deduction Wrong Percentage (8%)

**What it looks like:** Your pension should be 5% but 7% is being deducted.

**Impact:** €50-100/month.

**Fix:** Check contract, alert payroll, request refund of overpaid amount.

---

### Error 7: Bank Details Incorrect (3%)

**What it looks like:** Net pay doesn't arrive in your account.

**Impact:** Total non-payment until fixed.

**Fix:** Provide correct bank details immediately. Payment usually processed within 3-5 days.

---

## 05 — Your Monthly Payslip-Checking Routine

Checking your payslip thoroughly takes about 5 minutes. Do it every single month — it's one of the highest-return-on-time financial habits you can build.

![Your Monthly Payslip Check: 7-Step Routine](chart_1_2_4_v2_D_checking_routine.png)
*Figure 1.2.4-D — The seven-step monthly verification process. Following this routine every month catches errors before they compound.*

### The 7-Step Routine

**Step 1: Receive Payslip (Within 24 hours)**
- Download from employee portal or collect physical copy
- Don't wait weeks — check immediately

**Step 2: Check Gross Pay**
- Does it match your contract salary or expected wages?
- Is overtime included and calculated at correct rate?
- Are bonuses/allowances present if promised?

**Step 3: Verify Hours (Waged Employees)**
- Do hours on payslip match your timesheets/records?
- Keep your own log — never rely solely on employer records

**Step 4: Check All Deductions**
- Is tax code correct?
- Is pension percentage right?
- Are there any unexpected deductions?
- Do percentages match what they should be?

**Step 5: Verify Net Pay**
- Does net pay match the amount that hit your bank account?
- If not, investigate immediately (could be payslip error or banking delay)

**Step 6: Check Year-to-Date Totals**
- Are YTD figures accumulating correctly month-to-month?
- Do they make sense given your pay history?

**Step 7: File and Save**
- Save digital copy to secure folder
- Name it clearly: "Payslip_2026_January.pdf"
- Keep for at least 6 years (legal requirement in many countries)

## 06 — What to Do When You Find an Error

If you spot an error on your payslip:

### Table 1.2.4-C — Error Response Protocol

| Step | Action | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Document the error** | Screenshot or photocopy. Write down what's wrong. | Immediately |
| **2. Check your contract** | Confirm what the correct figure should be | Within 24h |
| **3. Email payroll** | Clearly state: what's wrong, what it should be, reference contract clause if relevant | Within 48h |
| **4. Follow up** | If no response in 3 working days, follow up | Day 4 |
| **5. Escalate if needed** | If payroll doesn't fix it, escalate to HR or manager | Week 2 |
| **6. Keep records** | Save all email correspondence | Ongoing |

**Template email:**

*Subject: Payroll Error — [Your Name] — [Pay Period]*

*Dear Payroll Team,*

*I've noticed an error on my payslip for the period [dates]:*

*- Issue: [Describe clearly, e.g., "Tax code shows 0T but should be 1250L"]*
*- Correct amount/code should be: [State what's correct]*
*- Supporting evidence: [Attach contract, tax code notice, timesheet, etc.]*

*Could you please investigate and advise on when this will be corrected and whether backpay or refund will be processed?*

*Thank you,*
*[Your name]*
*[Employee ID]*

> **Note — Don't Delay:** Payroll errors have time limits for correction in many jurisdictions (often 3-6 months). The longer you wait, the harder it is to recover overpaid tax or missing wages. Always report errors immediately.

## 07 — Real-World Examples

### Example 1 — The €5,000 Tax Code Error

> *"Marcus started a new job in January. His payslip showed tax code 0T (emergency code) — he didn't know what that meant so ignored it. For six months he was overpaying €426/month in tax. In June, a colleague mentioned checking tax codes. Marcus investigated, realised the error, contacted payroll. They corrected his code going forward but said he'd need to claim the €2,556 overpayment himself from the tax office. The claim took 4 months to process. Total time without that money: 10 months. All because he didn't check his first payslip."*

**The lesson:** Always check your tax code on your very first payslip. Emergency codes are meant to be temporary — if yours isn't corrected within a month, chase it aggressively.

---

### Example 2 — The Missing Overtime

> *"Siobhan worked retail on an hourly wage. In December, she worked 15 hours of overtime (1.5× rate = €22.50/hour). Her payslip showed zero overtime — €337.50 missing. She raised it immediately with payroll. They claimed her manager hadn't approved the overtime hours in the system. Siobhan had kept her own records and had her manager's approval in writing (text message). She forwarded both. Payroll added the €337.50 to her January pay with an apology. If she hadn't checked her payslip or kept records, she'd have lost €337.50 permanently."*

**The lesson:** For waged work, always keep your own record of hours worked. Never rely solely on employer systems. Timesheets can have errors or be submitted incorrectly by managers.

---

### Example 3 — The Pension Percentage Error

> *"David's contract specified 5% employee pension contribution with 5% employer match. For eight months, his payslip showed 7% employee contribution — an extra €70/month. He thought it was normal variation. Then a colleague showed him their payslip (same role, same contract) with 5%. David checked his contract, realised the error, and contacted payroll. They'd accidentally assigned him to the wrong pension tier. They corrected it going forward and refunded €560 (8 months × €70). But they initially refused the refund — David had to cite employment law and his contract to get it. The entire issue could have been avoided by checking his first payslip carefully."*

**The lesson:** Check percentages on your first payslip and again quarterly. Pension errors are common because pension schemes have multiple contribution tiers.
