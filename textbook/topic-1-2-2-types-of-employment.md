- Identify and describe the six main types of employment
- Explain the financial trade-offs of each employment type
- Calculate the true value of an employment package (beyond salary)
- Understand why self-employed people must charge more to receive equivalent compensation
- Recognise how the employment landscape has shifted over the past two decades
- Apply a decision framework to assess which employment type best fits your priorities

## 01 — Why Employment Type Matters Financially

Most people think of a job as a job. But the *type* of employment you choose has profound financial implications far beyond the headline salary:

- **How much tax you pay** (and how you pay it)
- **What benefits you receive** (or must fund yourself)
- **How secure your income is** (can it disappear overnight?)
- **What your income ceiling is** (can you grow beyond a salary?)
- **How much flexibility you have** (can you work when and where you choose?)

Two people can earn an identical "salary" and have dramatically different total compensation, financial stability, and long-term prospects — purely because of their employment type.

> **Note — No Employment Type Is Universally Better:** Each type has genuine advantages and trade-offs. The right choice depends on your life stage, financial situation, risk tolerance, and priorities. This lesson provides the information to make that choice consciously rather than by default.

## 02 — The Six Main Employment Types

### 1. Permanent Full-Time Employment

**What it is:** An ongoing, open-ended contract with a single employer for a fixed number of hours per week (typically 35-40).

**Financial characteristics:**
- Fixed, predictable salary paid monthly or bi-weekly
- Employer contributes to pension, often matching employee contributions
- Paid annual leave (typically 20-28 days in Europe)
- Sick pay protection — often full pay for weeks or months
- Health insurance in many countries, particularly US
- Career development and training often funded
- Statutory redundancy rights if role is eliminated

**Best for:** People prioritising stability, benefits, and career progression within an organisation.

**Watch out for:** Income ceiling determined by employer; salary growth depends on promotions or job changes; limited flexibility.

---

### 2. Contract / Fixed-Term Employment

**What it is:** Employment for a defined period — typically 6 months to 2 years — after which the contract ends or is renewed.

**Financial characteristics:**
- Usually higher day/hourly rate than permanent equivalent (to compensate for uncertainty)
- May or may not include pension/benefits (varies by contract)
- End date is known — requires planning ahead
- Less redundancy protection in most jurisdictions
- Easier to move between roles and industries

**Best for:** People wanting higher short-term income, building diverse experience, or working in project-based industries (tech, construction, consulting).

**Watch out for:** Income gap between contracts; lender caution (mortgages harder to obtain); requires proactive job-searching every 6-24 months.

---

### 3. Part-Time Employment

**What it is:** Employment for fewer than the standard full-time hours — typically under 30 hours per week.

**Financial characteristics:**
- Lower total income than full-time (proportional to hours)
- Usually includes pro-rated versions of permanent benefits (pension, holiday)
- Can be combined with other income sources
- Particularly common among students, parents, carers, and those semi-retiring

**Best for:** People needing flexibility, combining work with study or caring responsibilities, or supplementing income alongside other activities.

**Watch out for:** Income may not cover full financial needs alone; career progression can be slower; fewer development opportunities.

---

### 4. Freelance / Self-Employment

**What it is:** Working independently for multiple clients, typically project-by-project, charging a fee or day rate.

**Financial characteristics:**
- Set your own rates — potential for significantly higher income than equivalent employment
- No employer benefits — must fund own pension, insurance, sick pay
- Income is irregular and variable month-to-month
- Must manage own taxes (self-assessment), VAT (if applicable), invoicing, and accounting
- Full tax responsibility — income tax, social insurance as both employee and employer portions in many countries
- Business expenses can be deducted from taxable income

**Best for:** Skilled professionals with in-demand expertise and ability to manage the business side of self-employment.

**Watch out for:** Irregular income is genuinely stressful; isolation; self-discipline required; tax complexity.

---

### 5. Gig / Platform Work

**What it is:** Short, individual tasks arranged through digital platforms (Uber, Deliveroo, TaskRabbit, Fiverr, etc.) rather than traditional employment.

**Financial characteristics:**
- Pay per task, delivery, or hour — no fixed income
- No employment rights in most jurisdictions (no holiday, sick pay, pension)
- Complete flexibility — work as much or as little as you want
- Subject to platform algorithm changes, commission rates, and market demand
- Income is highly variable — often insufficient as sole income source
- Self-employed for tax purposes in most countries

**Best for:** Supplementary income alongside other work; maximum schedule flexibility; when starting out building a skill base.

**Watch out for:** No income floor or stability; no career progression; platform dependency (one change in algorithm or rates affects all earnings); worker classification disputes ongoing in many countries.

---

### 6. Zero-Hours Contracts

**What it is:** Employment where the employer is not obliged to offer any minimum hours, and the employee is not obliged to accept work when offered.

**Financial characteristics:**
- Complete income unpredictability — could work 0 or 40 hours in a given week
- Often includes minimal benefits
- Pay per hour worked only
- Legal protections vary by country — subject of significant ongoing legislative debate

**Best for:** Filling variable hours around other income; students needing maximum flexibility.

**Watch out for:** Cannot budget reliably; lenders will not accept as stable income; no income guarantee whatsoever; significant power imbalance with employer.

### Table 1.2.2-A — The Six Employment Types at a Glance

| Type | Income Stability | Benefits | Flexibility | Ceiling | Tax Complexity |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Permanent Full-Time** | Very high | Full | Low | Limited | Low |
| **Contract / Fixed-Term** | Moderate | Partial | Moderate | Moderate | Low-moderate |
| **Part-Time** | Moderate | Pro-rated | High | Low | Low |
| **Freelance / Self-Employed** | Low-variable | None (self-funded) | Very high | High | High |
| **Gig / Platform** | Very low | None | Maximum | Low | Moderate |
| **Zero-Hours** | None | Minimal | Maximum | Very low | Low |

## 03 — Employment Type Compared Across Five Dimensions

![Employment Types: A Five-Dimension Comparison](chart_1_2_2_A_employment_radar.png)
*Figure 1.2.2-A — Radar chart comparing six employment types across five dimensions. Freelance/self-employment scores highest on flexibility and income ceiling but lowest on security and benefits. Permanent employment is the inverse.*

### Reading the Radar

The most important insight from the chart: **no employment type excels at everything.** Every type involves genuine trade-offs.

- **Security ↔ Flexibility:** The most secure work (permanent) is the least flexible. The most flexible work (gig, zero-hours) is the least secure.
- **Benefits ↔ Income ceiling:** The most generous benefits packages (permanent) come with the most limited income ceilings. The highest potential income (freelance) has no benefits at all.
- **Stability ↔ Potential:** Predictable, stable income (salary) trades against the ceiling-free income potential of self-employment.

Understanding your own priorities — using the values framework from Lesson 1.1.10 — helps you make this trade-off consciously.

## 04 — The True Value of Employment: Beyond the Salary

One of the most common financial mistakes is comparing employment types using only the headline salary or rate. Benefits have significant monetary value — and their absence in self-employment must be factored into any comparison.

![True Value of Employment vs. Self-Employment](chart_1_2_2_B_true_cost_employment.png)
*Figure 1.2.2-B — A EUR38,000 salaried role with full benefits has a true total value of EUR53,110. A self-employed person would need to earn EUR52,000+ in fees to receive equivalent total compensation. Illustrative figures.*

### What Gets Missed in Salary Comparisons

### Table 1.2.2-B — The Hidden Value of an Employment Package

| Benefit | Annual Value (Illustrative) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Base salary** | €38,000 | The number everyone focuses on |
| **Employer pension contribution** | €2,850 | Typically 5-10% of salary |
| **Health insurance** | €2,200 | Varies enormously by plan and country |
| **Holiday pay** | €4,560 | 24 days × average daily rate |
| **Sick pay coverage** | €2,500 | Actuarial value of cover |
| **Training & development** | €1,800 | Courses, conferences, certifications |
| **Equipment** | €1,200 | Laptop, phone, software, workspace |
| **Total true value** | **€53,110** | 40% above salary |

### The Self-Employment Calculation

If you're comparing a €38,000 salary to a self-employed opportunity, you are not comparing "€38k vs. whatever the client pays." You're comparing **€53,110 in total compensation** to the self-employed earnings — minus the cost of replacing all those benefits yourself.

A self-employed person charging €52,000/year in fees must still cover:
- Own pension contributions (~€5,000/year to match employer contribution)
- Own health insurance (~€2,400/year private plan)
- No paid holiday (or fund it themselves)
- No sick pay (income stops when sick)
- Accounting fees (~€1,000-€1,500/year)

**After these costs, €52,000 in self-employed earnings may leave less net benefit than a €38,000 salaried role.**

> **Note — This Cuts Both Ways:** The calculation also reveals that self-employment starts to become financially superior once day rates are high enough to cover all these costs *and* generate more take-home than employment. Many experienced freelancers and consultants charge rates that make them substantially better off than any equivalent salaried role. The threshold is approximately 1.4-1.5× the salaried equivalent as a starting benchmark.

## 05 — The Changing Employment Landscape

The nature of work has shifted significantly over the past two decades — and the direction is accelerating.

![The Changing Shape of Employment (2005-2023)](chart_1_2_2_C_employment_trends.png)
*Figure 1.2.2-C — Permanent employment has declined from ~78% to ~60% of the workforce. Gig and platform work has grown from near-zero to approximately 8% since 2014. Based on labour market trends.*

### What's Driving the Shift

**1. Technology and platforms** — Apps like Uber, Deliveroo, Fiverr, and Upwork created entirely new categories of short-term, flexible work that simply didn't exist before 2010.

**2. Employer cost reduction** — Permanent employment is expensive (benefits, redundancy rights, management). Contractors and freelancers reduce fixed costs for companies.

**3. Worker preference shifts** — Particularly among younger generations, there's increased preference for flexibility, portfolio careers, and autonomy over traditional job security.

**4. Globalisation** — Remote work and digital platforms have enabled knowledge workers to serve international clients without leaving home — dramatically expanding the freelance market.

### The Financial Implications for Young People

This trend has important consequences for your generation:

- **You may have multiple employment types throughout your career** — possibly simultaneously
- **Employment rights and protections are weaker** for non-permanent workers — understanding what you're entitled to matters
- **Self-funding retirement becomes more critical** as employer pension contributions become rarer
- **Income volatility is more common** — emergency funds and financial buffers are more important than ever
- **Skills become personal assets** — in non-traditional work, your skills are your business

---

## 06 — Tax Implications by Employment Type

How much tax you pay — and how you pay it — varies significantly by employment type.

### Table 1.2.2-C — Tax Handling by Employment Type

| Employment Type | Who Handles Tax | Tax System | Key Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Permanent / Part-Time** | Employer (PAYE) | Deducted at source | You receive net pay; rarely need to file return |
| **Contract (via employer)** | Employer (PAYE) | Deducted at source | Same as permanent |
| **Contract (limited company)** | You (self-assessment) | Corporation tax + payroll | More flexibility, more complexity |
| **Freelance / Self-Employed** | You (self-assessment) | Income tax on profit | Pay tax 6-18 months after earning; requires budgeting for it |
| **Gig / Platform** | Platform withholds some; you report rest | Self-assessment | Easy to underpay tax if not careful |
| **Zero-Hours** | Employer (PAYE if employed) | Depends on classification | Some treated as workers, some as self-employed |

> **Note — Tax Timing Is a Cash Flow Issue for Self-Employed:** PAYE employees pay tax immediately — it never arrives in their account. Self-employed people receive full gross income, then must pay tax later (often 9-18 months after earning). This can feel like you have more money than you do. Classic mistake: spending your tax reserve before the bill arrives. Always set aside 25-35% of self-employed income for tax from the first day.

## 07 — Which Employment Type Is Right for You?

Different priorities lead to different optimal choices. Use this matrix as a starting framework.

![Employment Type Decision Matrix](chart_1_2_2_D_decision_matrix.png)
*Figure 1.2.2-D — Employment type decision matrix showing how each type fits different financial and lifestyle priorities. No single type excels at everything.*

### Choosing by Life Stage

### Table 1.2.2-D — Employment Type by Life Stage and Situation

| Life Stage / Situation | Recommended Starting Point | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Student / first job** | Part-time or contract | Build experience; flexibility for study |
| **Early career (22-28)** | Permanent full-time | Benefits, training, career development most valuable |
| **Stable career, ready to grow** | Freelance alongside job | Test self-employment with income safety net |
| **Highly skilled, in-demand** | Freelance or contract | Income ceiling opens up; benefits less critical |
| **Family responsibilities, mortgage** | Permanent or long contract | Stability and lender-friendly income documentation |
| **Semi-retirement / winding down** | Part-time or portfolio | Reduce hours while maintaining income |
| **Career transition** | Contract in new field | Build experience without permanent commitment |

> **Note — You Can Combine Types:** Many people hold multiple employment types simultaneously — a part-time permanent role plus freelance work, for example. Or a full-time job while building a side business toward eventual self-employment. The types aren't mutually exclusive; they're building blocks you can combine based on your current situation and goals.

## 08 — Real-World Examples

### Example 1 — The Same Skills, Very Different Outcomes

> *"Two graduates with identical marketing degrees and portfolios take different paths. Chloe joins a company on a EUR32,000 permanent salary — plus EUR2,400 pension, EUR2,100 health cover, EUR3,840 in holiday pay, and EUR2,000 in training. Total compensation: EUR42,340. Sam goes freelance at EUR250/day. If Sam works 200 days/year (industry average for new freelancers), she earns EUR50,000 gross — but after pension (EUR5,000), health insurance (EUR2,400), accounting (EUR1,200), equipment (EUR1,200), and business insurance (EUR800), her net effective compensation is EUR39,400. Near-identical to Chloe — despite earning EUR7,660 more in headline fees."*

**The lesson:** Headline earnings comparisons between employment types are almost always misleading. Calculate total compensation on both sides before deciding.

---

### Example 2 — Zero-Hours and the Budget Impossibility

> *"Darren, 22, accepted a zero-hours contract in retail. Some weeks he worked 38 hours. Others, 4 hours. Over three months, his income ranged from EUR160 to EUR1,080 per month. His rent was EUR620/month — fine in good weeks, impossible in bad ones. Without a buffer, he took out a payday loan twice. The interest eroded the little he'd saved in good weeks. The instability cost him significantly more than a lower-but-stable income would have."*

**The lesson:** Income variability without a buffer is financially catastrophic. Zero-hours contracts require 2-3 months of expenses in reserve *before* accepting them. Without that buffer, low-income-week costs compound through interest and fees.

---

### Example 3 — The Contract Ladder

> *"Ines, 26, works in data analytics. She spent two years in a permanent role (EUR38,000), built her skills, then moved to contracting. First contract: EUR280/day. After two contracts and three years: EUR420/day. She now works 230 days/year, earning EUR96,600 gross. She funds her own pension (EUR12,000/year), health insurance (EUR2,400), and accountant (EUR1,500). Net after tax and costs: approximately EUR58,000. Her permanent equivalent would be approximately EUR55,000 at this career stage. She earns slightly more, with complete autonomy — but works harder on business development and manages her own financial complexity."*

**The lesson:** The contract path can significantly outperform permanent employment — but only after building expertise that commands premium day rates. The window for this typically opens after 5-8 years of professional development.

## Lesson Summary

- There are **six main employment types**: permanent full-time, contract/fixed-term, part-time, freelance/self-employed, gig/platform, and zero-hours
- Each has genuine **trade-offs** — security ↔ flexibility, benefits ↔ income ceiling, stability ↔ potential
- **True employment value** extends well beyond salary — benefits (pension, insurance, holiday, training) can add 30-40% on top of base pay
- **Self-employed people must charge 1.4-1.5× the equivalent salary** to receive comparable total compensation after funding their own benefits
- The employment landscape is shifting: **permanent employment is declining** (78% → 60%), **gig work is rising** rapidly
- **Tax handling differs critically**: PAYE employees pay automatically; self-employed receive gross and must budget 25-35% for later tax payment
- **Zero-hours and gig work require financial buffers** — income variability without reserves creates a debt spiral
- No type is universally best — the right choice depends on life stage, financial situation, risk tolerance, and priorities
- **Types can be combined** — many people hold multiple employment types simultaneously
