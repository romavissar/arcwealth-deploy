## 01 — Defining Money

You use money every day — to buy food, top up your phone, or split the bill with friends. But have you ever stopped to ask: **what actually *is* money?**

At first glance, money seems obvious. It's the notes and coins in your pocket, or the balance on your phone. But that's only the *form* money takes today. In reality, money is far more interesting — it's one of humanity's greatest inventions.

> **Definition:** Money is any widely accepted **medium of exchange** that people use to trade goods and services, store value over time, and measure the worth of things.

Notice that definition doesn't say "paper" or "coins." That's deliberate. **Money is whatever a society collectively agrees to use as money.** It gets its power from trust and shared belief — not from the material it's made of.

A $10 note is worth $10 not because the paper costs $10, but because millions of people agree it does. Remove that agreement, and the paper is worthless. This is a profound idea that will shape how you think about all of finance.

## 02 — The Three Functions of Money

Economists agree that for something to be considered *money*, it must perform three functions:

### Table 1.1.1-A — The Three Functions of Money

| Function | What It Means | Without It… | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Medium of Exchange** | A tool people use to trade goods and services | You'd have to find someone who has what you want AND wants what you have (barter) | You give €5, you get a coffee |
| **Store of Value** | It holds its worth over time so you can save it | You'd need to immediately spend anything you earn before it spoils or loses worth | Money saved today can buy food next month |
| **Unit of Account** | A common way to measure and compare the value of things | How would you compare the "price" of a haircut in apples vs. sheep? | A laptop costs $800; headphones cost $150 |

> **Note — Why All Three Matter:** These three functions are interdependent. If money fails as a *store of value* (e.g., during extreme inflation), people stop trusting it as a *medium of exchange* too. This is exactly what happened in Zimbabwe in 2008, when inflation was so extreme that people abandoned the Zimbabwean dollar entirely.

## 03 — What Makes Good Money?

Not everything can be money. History is littered with failed attempts — giant stone wheels, cigarettes in prisons, beads, and more. Over centuries, certain **properties** emerged as essential for something to work well as money.

| Property | What It Means | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Durability** | Doesn't rot, rust, or degrade quickly | Gold lasts thousands of years; bread does not |
| **Divisibility** | Can be split into smaller units without losing value | $1 = 100 cents; 1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshis |
| **Portability** | Easy to carry and transport | Paper notes are easier than cattle |
| **Uniformity** | Each unit is identical to the next | One $10 note = exactly the same as another $10 note |
| **Limited Supply** | Can't be infinitely created or it becomes worthless | Gold must be mined; governments control printing |
| **Acceptability** | People trust and agree to use it | A currency is only useful if others will take it |

> **Note — This Applies to Crypto Too:** Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are often debated as "money." They score well on some properties (divisibility, portability, limited supply) but struggle on others (extreme volatility makes it a poor *store of value*, and limited acceptability means most shops won't take it). This is why the debate around crypto is so complex — we'll explore it in detail in Level 4.

## 04 — How Money Evolved

Money didn't appear overnight. It evolved over thousands of years as human societies grew more complex and trade became more important.

*Figure 1.1.1-A — The evolution of money from barter (~9000 BCE) to digital payments (2010s+)*

### Why Did Barter Fail?

Before money existed, people **bartered** — trading what they had for what they needed. But barter has a fatal flaw called the **"double coincidence of wants."**

If you're a farmer with extra wheat and you want shoes, you need to find a shoemaker who *specifically wants wheat* — at the exact moment you want shoes. The odds of this working out are slim. Now multiply this across an entire economy of millions of people.

## 05 — Forms of Money Today

In the modern world, money takes several forms. Most of what we call "money" today is actually **digital**.

![Modern Money Breakdown — Donut Chart](chart_money_donut.png)
*Figure 1.1.1-D — Approximate composition of the money supply in a typical developed economy*

> **Note — Where Did "Real" Money Go?** Roughly **90–95% of all money in existence is digital** — numbers in computers, not physical cash. When you tap your card, no coins move. Banks update two numbers in their databases. Money has become almost entirely abstract. This applies to most countries with modern banking systems.

### Table 1.1.1-B — Types of Money in Use Today

| Type | Description | Examples | Backed By |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Fiat Currency** | Government-issued money with no physical commodity backing it | EUR, USD, GBP, RON | Government trust & law |
| **Commodity Money** | Money with intrinsic value (the item itself has use) | Gold, silver (historical) | Physical material |
| **Representative Money** | A token that represents a claim on something valuable | Old gold-standard banknotes | Gold / silver reserves |
| **Digital / Electronic Money** | Money that exists only in electronic form | Bank deposits, PayPal, Revolut | Bank & government systems |
| **Cryptocurrency** | Decentralised digital currency using cryptography | Bitcoin, Ethereum | Code & consensus |

## 06 — Real-World Examples

### Example 1 — Cigarettes as Money in Prisons

> *"In some prison systems around the world, cigarettes have historically been used as a form of currency between inmates — even by non-smokers."*

Why? Cigarettes are **durable** (they last), **divisible** (you can trade individual cigarettes), **portable** (easy to carry), **uniform** (a Marlboro is a Marlboro), have **limited supply** (controlled by what comes in), and are **widely accepted** by other inmates.

This perfectly demonstrates that money is a *social agreement*, not a government decree. When normal currency is unavailable, people invent their own.

### Example 2 — Zimbabwe's Hyperinflation (2007–2009)

> *"At its peak in November 2008, Zimbabwe's inflation rate reached 89.7 sextillion percent per month. A loaf of bread that could cost $Z1 at the start of the year could cost billions by the end."*

When the government printed too much money, the **limited supply** property broke down completely. Zimbabwean dollars became so worthless that people started using foreign currencies (USD, South African Rand) instead. The government eventually abandoned the Zimbabwean dollar in 2009.

This shows what happens when money fails as a *store of value* — the entire system collapses. People lose faith, stop accepting it, and the economy grinds to a halt.

### Example 3 — Rai Stones of Yap Island

> *"On the island of Yap in the Pacific Ocean, the native people used giant limestone discs — some as tall as 4 metres — as a form of money. Some were so heavy they couldn't be moved."*

Instead of physically transferring the stones, the community simply *agreed* on a change of ownership. One famous stone sank to the bottom of the ocean during transport — and the community continued to accept it as valid currency, because everyone knew who owned it.

This is a powerful illustration that **money is fundamentally a shared ledger of trust** — not a physical object. Fascinatingly, modern economists often compare this to how blockchain ledgers work today.

## Lesson Summary

- Money is any widely accepted medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account
- Money gets its value from collective trust and agreement — not from what it's made of
- Good money must be durable, divisible, portable, uniform, scarce, and acceptable
- Money evolved from barter → commodity money → coins → paper → digital
- Today, roughly 90–95% of money is digital — numbers in bank computers
- When money fails its core functions (e.g. hyperinflation), societies find or invent alternatives
