## 01 — The Most Important Money Question

Before you spend a single euro or dollar, there's one question worth asking: **do I actually need this, or do I just want it?**

It sounds almost too simple. But consistently failing to answer it honestly is one of the most common reasons people run out of money, accumulate debt, or never manage to save. The distinction between a *need* and a *want* sits at the heart of almost every financial decision you'll ever make.

> **Definition — Need:** Something essential for basic survival, health, safety, or participation in modern life. Without it, your wellbeing is genuinely at risk.

> **Definition — Want:** Something that improves comfort, enjoyment, or status, but is not required for your basic functioning and survival.

The challenge is that in real life, the boundary between them is rarely a clean line.

## 02 — The Classic Framework

Economists and financial educators have long used a simple two-category model as a starting point:

### Table 1.1.2-A — Needs vs. Wants: The Classic Split

| Category | Definition | Core Examples | Grey Area Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Need** | Essential for survival, health, and functioning | Shelter, food, basic clothing, healthcare, transport to work | Internet access, a smartphone, heating above minimum |
| **Want** | Improves quality of life but isn't essential | Restaurants, gaming, designer clothes, streaming | A second streaming service, a newer phone model |

The grey area column is where most financial mistakes happen. Let's explore it.

### Why the Line Blurs

Consider internet access. In 1995, it was a luxury want. In 2025, many jobs, schools, government services, and healthcare systems require it. **A want in one era becomes a need in another.**

Or take a smartphone. Is it a need or a want? For a teenager doing homework, communicating with family, and navigating public transport using maps — it's arguably a need. But the *newest* model with the best camera? That part is a want.

> **Note — The Upgrade Trap:** The most common way needs and wants get confused is through *upgrades*. You need a phone. You want the latest model. You need shoes. You want expensive trainers. The base item is a need — the premium version is a want. Recognising this distinction can save you hundreds of euros every year.

## 03 — Where Common Expenses Fall

Most spending can be mapped onto a spectrum from "pure need" to "pure want." Very few things sit cleanly at either extreme — most fall somewhere in between.

![Needs vs. Wants: How Common Expenses Break Down](chart_1_1_2_A_needs_wants_split.png)
*Figure 1.1.2-A — Illustrative needs/want split for common expense categories. Percentages vary by individual and circumstance.*

Notice that even "food" isn't 100% need. Basic groceries are a need. A €40 dinner out is a want. That's why food sits at 70/30 — roughly 70% of what most people spend on food is genuinely necessary, while around 30% is convenience, pleasure, and social experience.

> **Note — These Are Averages, Not Rules:** The split shown above is illustrative. Someone who needs to eat out for work reasons has a different calculation than someone choosing restaurants purely for enjoyment. Context always matters when categorising expenses.

## 04 — How Wants Grow with Income

Here's a pattern almost everyone falls into without realising it: as income rises, wants tend to expand even faster.

![How Wants Grow with Income](chart_1_1_2_B_want_escalation.png)
*Figure 1.1.2-B — As income rises across career stages, the share of spending devoted to wants grows significantly. This is the foundation of "lifestyle inflation," covered in detail in Topic 1.1.7.*

Notice what happens: a student on €1,000/month might spend about 10% on wants. By the time someone earns €8,000/month, wants can account for over 50% of spending — even though their *needs* haven't changed all that dramatically.

This is called **lifestyle inflation** — and it's one of the most powerful forces working against long-term wealth. We'll explore it fully in Lesson 1.1.7. For now, the key takeaway is: **more income doesn't automatically mean more savings.** Not if wants expand to fill the gap.

### Table 1.1.2-B — The Wants Escalation Pattern

| Income Level | Typical Monthly Needs | Typical Monthly Wants | Wants as % of Spending |
|---|---|---|---|
| €1,000/month (student) | €800 | €100 | ~10% |
| €2,000/month (entry job) | €1,100 | €600 | ~30% |
| €4,000/month (mid-career) | €1,600 | €1,800 | ~45% |
| €8,000/month (senior role) | €2,200 | €4,200 | ~52% |

*Illustrative figures. Actual splits vary widely by location, lifestyle, and personal choices.*

## 05 — The Long-Term Cost of Getting This Wrong

Being blurry about needs and wants doesn't just affect your monthly budget. It compounds over time.

![The 10-Year Cost of Confusing Wants for Needs](chart_1_1_2_C_cost_of_confusion.png)
*Figure 1.1.2-C — Three people with the same income but different savings habits. Person A clearly separates needs from wants and saves €200/month. Person B is fuzzy on the distinction and saves €50/month. Person C treats all wants as needs and saves nothing. Assumes 6% annual growth.*

The gap after just 10 years is striking. Person A ends up with roughly **four times more** than Person B — not because they earned more, but because they were clearer about what they actually needed. This is the power of the needs/wants distinction applied consistently over time.

> **Note — This Gets Even More Dramatic Over 30–40 Years:** The chart above covers just 10 years. If you extend this to a full working life of 35–40 years, the difference between saving €200/month and €50/month compounds into hundreds of thousands of euros. We'll see the full force of compounding in Topic 2.3.

## 06 — Why We Struggle to Tell the Difference

If the concept is simple, why do so many people get it wrong? Because several powerful forces work to blur the line:

### 1. Marketing and Advertising

Advertising's entire job is to make *wants feel like needs*. "You need the new iPhone." "Don't you deserve better skin?" "Everyone's driving this car." These messages are engineered by some of the smartest people on the planet, backed by billions in research, and delivered to you hundreds of times every day.

> **Note — Advertising Spend:** Global advertising spending exceeded $900 billion in 2023. Most of that money is aimed at one goal: turning wants into felt needs. Being aware of this doesn't make you immune — but it helps.

### 2. Social Comparison

When everyone around you owns something — the same trainers, the same phone, the same subscription — it starts to feel like a need. This is called **social norming**, and it's one of the most powerful financial forces teens and young adults face.

### 3. Habit and Comfort

A daily coffee used to be a want. If you've had one every morning for five years, it starts to feel like a need. The brain encodes comfort patterns as necessities. This doesn't mean you must cut the coffee — it means you should *choose* it consciously, not confuse it with rent.

### 4. Context Shifting

What counts as a need varies by country, city, job, and life stage. A car is a want in central London (excellent public transport). A car is a need in rural Romania (no alternative transport). Always evaluate needs *in your context*, not based on a universal rule.

## 07 — A Practical Framework: The 3-Question Test

When you're unsure whether something is a need or a want, try these three questions:

### Table 1.1.2-C — The 3-Question Test

| Question | If Yes → | If No → |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Would my health, safety, or ability to work/study be at risk without this?** | Likely a need | Probably a want |
| **2. Is there a cheaper version that would meet the same core function?** | The cheaper version is the need; the upgrade is a want | Possibly still a need |
| **3. Am I buying this because I genuinely require it, or because I saw it advertised / someone else has it?** | Social want — be honest | Might be a genuine need |

You don't need to obsess over every purchase. But applying this test to anything over €30–50 can prevent a significant amount of financial drift over time.

## 08 — Real-World Examples

### Example 1 — The Smartphone Upgrade Cycle

> *"Apple releases a new iPhone every year. Millions of people who already own a perfectly functioning phone feel compelled to upgrade. In 2023, the average American spent over $400/year on phone upgrades and accessories."*

The need here is *a functioning smartphone* — which most people already have. The want is the new model. Marketing, social pressure, and the dopamine hit of unboxing something new conspire to make the upgrade feel necessary.

**Financial impact:** If instead of upgrading annually you upgraded every 3 years and invested the €300–400 difference each year, over 10 years (at 6% growth) that single habit change would generate approximately **€4,000 in additional savings**.

---

### Example 2 — The University Student Budget

> *"Amara starts university with a €900/month student loan. Within two months, she's overdrawn. When she maps her spending, she finds €340 going to restaurants, delivery apps, clothes, and streaming — all categorised in her mind as 'just living'."*

Amara's problem isn't that she spent money on wants — it's that she hadn't separated them from her needs budget. Once she did, she found she could cover all genuine needs with €620/month, leaving €280 to consciously allocate: some to small wants, some to savings.

**The key shift:** She didn't stop spending on wants. She *decided* to spend on them, rather than drifting into it.

---

### Example 3 — "Basic" Needs That Aren't So Basic

> *"A family in central Paris considers their subscription to three streaming platforms, a gym membership, and weekly restaurant visits to be 'standard living costs.' A family of similar income in rural Portugal considers a car, higher heating bills, and a weekly market shop their 'standard costs.'"*

Neither family is wrong — their needs genuinely differ by context. This example highlights that **needs are not universal**. Comparing your spending to someone in a different city, country, or life stage is often misleading. Define your needs in *your* context.

## Lesson Summary

- A **need** is something essential for survival, health, safety, or functioning in modern life
- A **want** is something that improves comfort or enjoyment but is not essential
- The line between them is blurry — and intentionally blurred by advertising, social pressure, and habit
- The **upgrade trap** is the most common confusion: the base item is a need, the premium version is a want
- Wants tend to grow with income (lifestyle inflation) — more money doesn't automatically mean more savings
- The **3-Question Test** (health/safety risk, cheaper alternative, external influence) helps clarify any purchase
- Getting this distinction right consistently, over years, is one of the most powerful things you can do for your finances
